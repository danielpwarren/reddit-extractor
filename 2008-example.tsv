1.0 I like the M x doctor more. I can run it in another buffer and know that it's there, waiting for me, patient and kind, as long as I want.	1.0 the longer the better, eh!??!
1.0 It depends. Are you 55? EOS 1.0 no. I'm not even 10 years older. For some reasons my friends think it would be wrong. I'm confused.	1.0 Just make sure she isn't some immature ditz and you're probably ok.
1.0 Just to go with the ubiquitous, a LAMP server. Simple, efficient and commonplace.	1.0 LAMP, the AK47 of the internet.

1.0 I've always said eee you el ey however one of my co workers says yuula This has made me wonder, could I be wrong?	1.0 Ulla, because it's how the martians would say it.
1.0 I've always said eee you el ey however one of my co workers says yuula This has made me wonder, could I be wrong? EOS 1.0 I say it like you la	1.0 I tend to drift between e yoo la and the above. Never L a though.
1.0 For instance, Fark and Metafilter have pretty strong community bonds. Sometimes I wish reddit had something like that. Wishful thinking I guess.	1.0 Seriously it is nothing but wishful thinking. In the same amount of time I have spent here, I would have made fewer friends than you I guess.
1.0 There is something called IRC. This is a news site that upvotes and downvotes articles and comments.	1.0 Downmodded for reducing my daily hobby to it's depressing actual reality.
1.0 Around 4 5 EOS 1.0 And have they all got similar karma scores?	1.0 Nope, this is my good one :D I don't ever really use the other ones unless I feel like it.
1.0 Because most things submitted are pretty shit, or old, or dupes, or a combination of all these. EOS 1.0 Are you saying you downmod most things? EOS 1.0 No, but from the new page, on average, I'd upmod 3 or 4, downmod 5 or 6, and ignore the rest	1.0 Well, that is normal. I do the same.
1.0 Vancouver, WA.	1.0 cool that might be a good bet, near portland too!

1.0 1984 is an important one, and really good. Besides that, Watership Down , The Plot Against America , Brave New World . EOS 1.0 Brave new world is good. EOS 1.0 Watership Down is good. EOS 1.0 Not saying it wasn't, I just hadn't read it before. EOS 1.0 You oughta. It's the only book I've ever re read. Just sayin'.	1.0 Well, thats why the topic is here I guess. When I am not so busy i'll check it out.

I can't think of a book that I own that I haven't read at least twice, barring texts.
1.0 The Bible. EOS 1.0 I just got to the big trial seen of Jesus. Very suspenseful. Don't tell me how it ends I want to be surprised.	1.0 He cuts off Anakin's legs and he becomes Darth Vader.
1.0 The Mote in God's Eye The Final Encyclopedia This House is Not a Home any Shakespeare	1.0 The Mote in Gods Eye was great.
1.0 Man, Iain M. Banks's best SF are the first three straight up Culture ones: Consider Phlebas, The Player of Games, Use of Weapons.	1.0 You're not counting Excession as a Culture novel?
1.0 The Great Gatsby. EOS 1.0 I read this every ten years or so, and every time I do it amazes me again. EOS 1.0 How many times have you read it... grandpa? :P	1.0 Four or five. Enough so that when I shave I'm careful to get every last damn bit of shaving cream off my face.
1.0 The Bible. EOS 1.0 it's good for a chuckle	1.0 i found it smutty.
1.0 The Brothers Karamazov EOS 1.0 i've heard good things about it elsewhere. i'm going to give it a read.	1.0 I would consider it the authors best work. And that's saying a lot, as most of everything he wrote was great.
1.0 I've read but one Dostoevsky, The Idiot , and thought it was excellent.	1.0 Read his other stuff, especially The Brothers Karamazov. I personally think The Idiot is not one of his best but really, everything he wrote was pretty freaking good.
1.0 grapes of wrath EOS 1.0 Steinbeck, always a good decision EOS 1.0 Isn't he Mr. I don't name female characters?	1.0 I never noticed that, but I cant seem to recall any female characters by name. I'll research it a little more, but I'm sure you're right.
1.0 yourself, nude, with flowers?	1.0 Mental imagery I didn't need.
1.0 When you buy a stock you are sort of taking a loan from a company, You give them a loan...	1.0 no sorry, you are taking a share from another person, not the company directly in 99.99 of the cases unless you contact the company and purchase shares directly
1.0 Ming the Merciless is my key example, although there are more. So is the uniqueness of one's facial hair proportional to how evil they are?	1.0 This suggests that women and clean shaven men cannot be evil so yes .
1.0 George Bush No Facial Hair Santa Big white beard	1.0 Santa's big white beard isn't unique though, whereas I've never known anyone to wear Ming's evil tache goatee combo.
1.0 so that's why my karma has been dropping. makes sense. EOS 1.0 Maybe people who don't like some comment you made are going to your profile and downvoting your submissions. To hell with karma anyway. It can't buy beer or pull women.	1.0 Maybe not for you.
1.0 If they don't listen to your vote, why would they listen to an online petition?	1.0 Good point, but I feel like its better than nothing. The grassroots FISA support seemed like it had an impact.
1.0 Do you also want the people who downmod this?	1.0 Ha. No. Yes. Maybe.
1.0 You got the Jimmy legs.	1.0 You can get rid of it, if you're OK with some increased gambling.
1.0 I do that all of the time. It drives everyone around me nuts. I rationalise it as exercise.	1.0 Yeah, I pace , I'll do things like walk to my closet, turn on the light, turn if off, walk across the room, and repeat.
1.0 I'm a phone walker, too.	1.0 i'm not, but i have a friend who is
1.0 Fear of being chased around a kitchen table by wolves while wearing socks on a newly waxed linoleum floor?	1.0 They seemed similar. Maybe phonostillophobia?
1.0 Gong Fu? EOS 1.0 The modern transliteration of the old term Kung Fu .	1.0 Yea, since that roman guy invented the letter G we figured we might as well use it.
1.0 Heh. In her last moments she may have approached the hypothesized Proto Indo European language.	1.0 Need a few more than that, but yep, pretty cool polyglot.
1.0 Gong Fu? EOS 1.0 The modern transliteration of the old term Kung Fu . EOS 1.0 Well, 'Gong' would be the correct pinyin transliteration, no?	1.0 Yes, I thought you were unfamiliar with the concept.
1.0 From the 'Super Best Friends' episode, Muhammed was there. How come that was okay but newspaper publishers in Denmark got bombed?	1.0 Maybe they actually thought 'Super Best Friends' was worthy. I mean, their guy did use his fire to help craft a huge John Wilkes Booth to take out pro empire Lincoln.
1.0 The thing is, I can go around to the user's page and see the comment, so I know its still there. Just can't see it where I can reply.	1.0 Interesting. Definitely a glitch. Someone should contact the admin about this.
1.0 This blatant ask reddit abuse! This belongs in politics!	1.0 I would then need the heading to say something like... Ron Paul Really likes the expanded coverage
1.0 Hey, so noob question: Can I make my own subreddit yet?	1.0 I think you need to be granted moderator status. I am a netsec moderator and I can. This is probably a spez or a jedberg request?
1.0 he was born 200 years ago today. Huckabee is scared of him EOS 1.0 Richard Dawkins?!	1.0 oooh, so close!
1.0 The red box on reddit kicks ass because it stands out so much. The whole site is done in light colors, then...BAM little red box, you can't miss it. EOS 1.0 Yep, that's exactly it. I've seen no other mainstream forum have that design including internet forums EOS 1.0 Do you get semi excited when your box lights up orange?	1.0 I DO
1.0 Click the edit tab below and go to the subreddits you selected but aren't visible.	1.0 Err... I get that. I meant an easier way to do that since that is what the sidebar provides.
1.0 Would you grow super hand muscles? Or just grow fat?	1.0 Just grow fat most probably.
1.0 Gnothi Seauton	1.0 Best advice ever.
1.0 We just made an update to how karma is calculated on other reddits, and some users received a bonus. Surprise!	1.0 Caused by the new calculation method, a bug, general good will, or...? Just curious.
1.0 We just made an update to how karma is calculated on other reddits, and some users received a bonus. Surprise!	1.0 I didn't get a boost. Damn you spez! You'll probably vote for McCain next. What is the world coming to?
1.0 My karma went from 1... to 1...	1.0 mine has stayed there too, a long long time. 1 karma point subreddit anyone? successful karma whores need not submit!

1.0 My favorite band is Karma Whore	1.0 I've been on reddit for almost a year and only posted 3 articles. Trust me, I'm not in it for the karma.
1.0 It would work like this: 2 separate karma numbers. One would work like normal, but the second one would only apply to comments.	1.0 Do a search for comment karma , this has been discussed millions of times, and is generally thought to be a bad idea.
1.0 No. All it would do is keep people from speaking their mind and make the political correctness on reddit even worse. Fuck that.	1.0 Then take away karma altogether. Fuck this half ass shit.
1.0 Dark brown.	1.0 Every color but dark brown. That's why it reflects dark brown.
1.0 Well, this is the first one in many many tries that has stayed!! Is there a bug in the system?	1.0 don't know but this happens to me, too. my solution was to give up posting stories. that's worked pretty well so far.
1.0 How do you know they only appear to you? Logging out?	1.0 sorry, it posted on top of the comment I was replying to. My fault.
1.0 I read this comment months ago. New subreddit needed reddit.recycled comments EOS 1.0 Huh? I just wrote it.. someone else wrote the same thing?	1.0 you have been cloned, didn't anyone tell you?
1.0 I don't think they should be summarily blocked. I think people should know better than to vote it up.	1.0 very true. I'm a new page person though. I guess i have to accept the hazard then
1.0 I said lawyer, not Darth Vader.	1.0 May the force be with you.
1.0 I don't see how this could make it much more difficult. Most of reddit is handicapped anyways.	1.0 Seriously? Not only that this was posted here, but that it's getting upmodded?
1.0 Funny thing is, my friends camera is broken and it's doing the exact same thing.	1.0 That is funny.
1.0 I am going to post here every time I realize I am slacking the fuck off. Once I am done writing this I get back to work.	1.0 another post for slacking. Alright back to work
1.0 I hate pseudo intellectuals who quote others and think they're smart. Make up your own phrases bitch. EOS 1.0 One only needs to read your comments to know the path of a true intellectual. I worship at the feet of the master. EOS 1.0 Thank you, thank you. Your life will be spared in the new epoch!	1.0 Epoch fail.

1.0 have you read it? EOS 1.0 Yeah, but I need someone to sum up the most interesting thing about it. I can't think of a single most prevalent thing about it.	1.0 That, in the end, the hero loses Winston repudiates all that he holds dear. That Big Brother is always watching.
1.0 have you read it? EOS 1.0 Yeah, but I need someone to sum up the most interesting thing about it. I can't think of a single most prevalent thing about it.	1.0 read it again. i was going to cancel this comment but i thought you might like to reread it in context.
1.0 People subscribe to different subreddits.	1.0 You pwned him.
1.0 The day I can uncheck self.reddit.com	1.0 It's not technologically possible yet. Your lack of vision has not made it possible.
1.0 taking a shit	1.0 That is some vision you got there.
1.0 Welcoming some type of overlord.	1.0 Bush part two?
1.0 But you'll be old. EOS 1.0 Hopefully not.	1.0 I will invest into your fledgling internet company, hotboobiesornot.org.
1.0 Horses drinking coffee. EOS 1.0 They have whores drinking coffee, if you'd settle for that.	1.0 I guess that will have to do, but it is a monumental concession on my part.
1.0 I just tried twice to submit a link to myspace.com page and it never showed up under the new tab. EOS 1.0 happens to me every time, so i stopped submitting stories.	1.0 with the same site? it only happened to me with this one so far. all other submissions went through.

1.0 I think the best would be an option of All reddits except and you can list reddits you want to exclude	1.0 You could make it like a spam filter: Approved Blocked politics nsfw
1.0 You mean, like audafe has proven is quite doable? If only it had a community, it'd be a reddit killer. Like anything, really. You can't kill google, google has word of mouth.	1.0 You can't even fucking kill google. Not even with chairs.
1.0 You mean, like audafe has proven is quite doable? If only it had a community, it'd be a reddit killer. Like anything, really. You can't kill google, google has word of mouth. EOS 1.0 And 6 million engineers... EOS 1.0 1 of the world's population are engineers and they work for google? i doubt it. EOS 1.0 That's it. I'm firing my fact checkers.	1.0 You should fire 7oby's. According to him, the world only has 600 million people.
1.0 Yeah. I don't like a post having only 1 point being in the top 25.	1.0 If you are getting only low quality posts from a particular subreddit, unsubcribe yourself from that subreddit.
1.0 I just upvoted this without clicking the link.	1.0 Yeah, me too. But then of course I had to click it to boast of my amazing feat.
1.0 No it's not just me or no there isn't any crap on your front page?	1.0 No, you will not make it.
1.0 Seconded. I'm enjoying the more diverse, faster changing front page.	1.0 the more dynamic front page is a plus, i have to admit.
1.0 Seconded. I'm enjoying the more diverse, faster changing front page.	1.0 I'm not noticing the front page changing as quickly mainly because the stuff from the subreddits with fewer submissions hangs around too long.
1.0 The homepage only shows 20 subreddits. If you're subscribed to more than 20 subreddits, you currently can't choose which 20 get shown on the homepage.	1.0 That's it exactly. I was hoping one of the reddit crew would weigh in on this. jedberg? spez?
1.0 Into the pit with the Rancor? EOS 1.0 Sarlac. Slowly digested over a thousand years. EOS 1.0 Except if you're Boba Fett. EOS 1.0 Ya, he got away. Hmmm gota think about that now. EOS 1.0 Solution: give the reddit submissions Mandalorian armor and they'll be okay.	1.0 We still don't know if the pit died in the explosion. I don't want reddit to have self exploding submissions.
1.0 First day of Spring!	1.0 his offspring?
1.0 the first clause of your second sentence has no verb	1.0 1. Thanks for pointing that out. No sarcasm was intended or implied by that statement.

1.0 How do I become a reddit moderator? I want to moderate. I think that would be fun.	1.0 I'm fairly sure each moderated subreddit has its own moderators i.e., they're not moderated by Reddit.
1.0 How do I become a reddit moderator? I want to moderate. I think that would be fun.	1.0 Make your own subreddit. moderate there.
1.0 Or you could just use tags...	1.0 Tags would not solve this particular problem.
1.0 I haven't been on Digg in over six months. Is there a suppourt group somewhere for people like me?	1.0 You're in it now!
1.0 Nothing odd about it. Politics are generally orthogonal to personality. EOS 1.0 Though I wish that were true, I disagree. It's personality that causes conservatives to be pro life and pro death penalty, for example. EOS 1.0 Not so much personality as upbringing. Most people don't have very well thought out, personal reasons for their political beliefs.	1.0 Therein lies a debate, how much of our personalities is due to upbringing?

1.0 Not really.Nobody listens to you unless you're out on the streets. EOS 1.0 More specifically, nobody listens to you unless you're being an asshole or an obvious target of ridicule. EOS 1.0 And then there's risk of people taking the opposite side of your argument just to spite you.	1.0 ah yes, that too

1.0 I want to know if I can get at the very least 45K to just read reddit for eight hours day. EOS 1.0 Yes, at pretty much any corporation with internet access.	1.0 Not true, I can usually only get about 2 or 3 hours max.

1.0 Willpower: Just stop. It most certainly won't kill you or put you in a hospital. If that doesn't work, I say it is because you don't really want to stop.	1.0 Also, stop drinking for a while. It's impossible to say no to a smoke when you're drunk.

1.0 Hopefully because the recommendation engine is going away? After the user created subreddits came about, I don't think there is much need for it.	1.0 The recommendation engine is not going away, but there is work being done on it to improve it. This, however, is a bug that's being looked into
1.0 Because there's nothing worth reading any more. I just browse through the lolcats subreddit occasionally for teh lolz.	1.0 So I cant haz rekomendz?

1.0 You also seem to have been unable to remember that you posted the headline once, and went ahead and posted it again. You probably have early onset alzheimer's or something. EOS 1.0 guy made a mistake.. no need to insult him	1.0 You're assuming that it was a mistake.

1.0 you'd make a fine jello salad for some passing scavengers.	1.0 2 words: Limestone Cave. Yeah, limestone cave, dog. I have this covered from every angle. Who's going with me?

1.0 I'd take back a box of magic tricks and start a new religion. EOS 1.0 All you would need is a Bic lighter and a gun.	1.0 Totally. Survival materials are completely useless when you have the opportunity to reign over civilizations.
1.0 I don't understand. Are there some axes that are NOT portable??? Are they the ones you have to plug in?	1.0 That's a typo he meant ' potable ' ax, that's why he neglected to include drinking materials. He intends to drink the ax.

1.0 You'd be quartered, drawn and hung by the balls before dawn EOS 1.0 What if you just bring...Chuck Norris?	1.0 Please do... and leave him there.
1.0 Last I checked, there was water available that didn't fall from the sky. EOS 1.0 How did you get back here so quickly? EOS 1.0 He didn't. In a freak accident, the micro organisms he drank gave him eternal life. He has now been alive over 10,000 years.	1.0 I plan to go back again in a couple thousand years, after the time machine is invented again. It was nicer before everyone was all civilized and shit.
1.0 No, you're a faggot. EOS 1.0 I love you and forgive you, kodfish, for whatever troubles life may have caused you.	1.0 lt 3 internet
1.0 What good would any of that do? No one would speak any present day language, let alone read it. EOS 1.0 English as a Second Language books? EOS 1.0 Do they make those in ancient Gaullish?	1.0 No, but they make them in pretty pictures and large simple drawings.
1.0 You are going to get shot 10,000 years ago?	1.0 with a bow? maybe. with a stolen gun? who knows. especially with the war technology i would be giving to whatever village accepted me.
1.0 Wait! You're bringing an iPhone? Who you gonna call?	1.0 I don't like the sound of this...
1.0 I'd be too productive if I worked between 9 5, so I dilute about 80 of that with reddit.	1.0 Shoot, man, I'm too productive even with reddit. I have to read web comics and play flash games too.
1.0 Cuz I keep trying to figure oue what reddit is supposed to mean.	1.0 You read articles. It's like read it .

1.0 The easy on the eyes interface. The great content.	1.0 exactly. few colors, one ad per page, awesome, interesting links. Even if 50 of the page is crap, that's still a hell of a lot of great links.
1.0 The pun threads. EOS 1.0 they truly are the fabric of this internet society EOS 1.0 They tie the community together. EOS 1.0 And sew entertaining! EOS 1.0 but that's knot the only reason.	1.0 Not for the innocent sheep but it knits up the ravelled sleeve of care.

1.0 The concept of moderators is so 1.0 Get with the times reddit!	1.0 And having presidents in charge of your country is so outdated too. Mob rule FTW.
1.0 That logic... doesn't work either. If I don't vote, then I don't support either side. And if my vote doesn't count, then it doesn't matter anyway.	1.0 Your absence of a vote places more weight on votes of citizens who are voting. Can you please dilute the evil with your watered down vote?
1.0 It's like this: At this point, he is the least 'evil' candidate, and compared to the other's he's practically a saint. EOS 1.0 See, I hate that. If that's the only reason why everybody's pouring out support, I think I might as well just not vote at all. EOS 1.0 if you don't vote at all you get McCain because his boys will sure as hell vote. 'en masse! How does 100 more years of war sound to you?	1.0 McCain's on record as being pro 10,000 years in Iraq if possible.
1.0 Cake or death?	1.0 Church of England.

1.0 No need for bold.	1.0 If you put a sign at the start of the line, looks like this. Use a in front it looks like this. slashes become one, etc.
1.0 He likes coal and doesn't consider clean coal to be a contradiction in terms. Also, he can't write a bash script to save his life. EOS 1.0 Yeah, why don't we have more pebble bed reactors?	1.0 Because the word 'nuclear' is too hard for most American to pronounce. I mean, look at our president.
1.0 ben folds or wilco or the beatles	1.0 i'm with you on the last two.
1.0 ben folds or wilco or the beatles	1.0 I'm with you on the first one.

1.0 Dostoevsky The Brothers Karamazov you won't be sorry.	1.0 loved it. great summer book.
1.0 Minus 'Bell Jar' and Ayn Rand, not a bad list. EOS 1.0 minus Bell Jar? you must be mad.	1.0 Sylvia Plath wrote some amazing stuff Bell Jar is not part of it. It's terrible prose. Stick with the poetry. It's more powerful anyway.
1.0 I prefer scotch and soda Johnny Walker black or green. Edit: It's Friday and I'm looking for some good new ideas for tonight.	1.0 Gin and grapefruit juice. boring, maybe, but i never heard of anyone making it
1.0 powers on the rocks and a pabst. bitchin.	1.0 Lone Star!

EOS 1.0 So... what's in a monkeycum? EOS 1.0 I don't know, but it tastes like bananas.	1.0 Monkey Cum in the UK is banana juice.
1.0 Guinness with a slice of lemon. Do not mock that which you have not tried. EOS 1.0 Manlaw: No fruit in beer. EOS 1.0 Fuck that! A Negra Modelo just isn't a Negra Modelo without a slice of lime. EOS 1.0 As a good hefeweizen can also benefit from a slice of orange.	1.0 Very true!

EOS 1.0 my best friend victoria, but I do suppose that wouldn't make this very exciting or relatable.	1.0 That's good though. Even though it doesn't pertain to me, I think that seeing the different responses was the OP's purpose.

1.0 Dude, you can read books, watch movies, or play Xbox for entertainment. You don't need to talk to a woman. EOS 1.0 There's nobody else alive to run the electricity... EOS 1.0 I'm pretty sure the generators are automated enough to run on their own for a while. And when they give out, solar panels and batteries are free for the taking. EOS 1.0 But there's no one to play multiplayer with.	1.0 There's one person. You can teach her to play Xbox. It's better than talking to her.
1.0 I think there's probably some Taoist epigram that applies to this.	1.0 Man, there's a Taoist epigram for everything.

1.0 to avoid thinking about silly questions like this one.	1.0 It's silly to think about what you're doing with your life? You're just going to drift along aimlessly until one day you die?
1.0 Balance and perversion are human concepts. Nature simply is.	1.0 You're confusing the existence of balance and perversion with our rationalization of them. They exist in nature, independent from the names and definitions we give them.

1.0 Are you satisfied with life?	1.0 It's been pretty good so far.
1.0 Are you satisfied with life?	1.0 Life is what it is. Introducing baseless and self contradictory imaginary variables into it doesn't make it any more satisfying. In fact, it causes headaches and stomachaches.

1.0 Make some categories so people don't have to reveal exact ages	1.0 you scared of the interwebs?
1.0 You are supposed to up vote the category you are in, not make a new one. Delete and try again.	1.0 I didn't like any of the existing categories.
1.0 This has rather failed.	1.0 Depends on how you look at it. It has certainly answered several questions. Whether or not that is a success is debatable.
1.0 People are downmodding demographics? Weird. Or good. Not sure.	1.0 i hate people over 66 so much that i am preemptively downvoting this so that even if there is somebody that old on reddit, it seems like there isn't.

1.0 I had this problem for a long time. The way I solved it was to change my preferences to open links in a new window. EOS 1.0 I do that also.. but since I view so many links and update the page, every once in a way, I just simply loose a link I wanted to upmod. EOS 1.0 Resubmit the article and it takes you to the original submission. With the number of submissions you do, I'm surprised you haven't discovered this yet.	1.0 That's subreddit based, so if it was submitted to gadgets but he's trying technology, they won't collide.

1.0 Genetically engineering women to remove the hymen is a bad idea, because I like to see a virgin girl bleed after I break it. Turns me on. EOS 1.0 In fact, we should genetically engineer women so that the hyman regrows at the time of her period.	1.0 There is an Arabian nights story with exactly that kind of girl.

1.0 I use one with an intruder attack system. 24 hours after it is stolen, it asplodes an takes the thief with it. I think it's the Sanyo Bitchbuster series.	1.0 Sounds great.
1.0 Mobile? You mean cell.	1.0 Most people in Europe call it a mobile phone, not a cell phone.
1.0 Well I used my last one for everything diary functions, sending sms, camera, although not mp3.	1.0 Ah, well unfortunately in that case I am mostly unqualified to recommend anything.
1.0 Thanks for this I'll check it out. I don'3 really want a monthly contract though	1.0 Well, the early termination free is only 175. So even if I did that, I'd still be getting the phone for 150, which is a great price without a contract.

Crucial difference here as only one can be verified as true EOS 1.0 They commit more crimes. However, they are also, on average, poorer and less educated than whites. When you adjust for education and income, they commit the same amount of crimes.	1.0 But, since there are fewer of them, you are still going to have to say per capita or you'll be wrong. Right?

1.0 I went to a top 10 university in America, and I can't say my experience was all that different...	1.0 Don't know if it's true ... but the fact that you're being down modded shows that it's socially unacceptable to state.

1.0 If there isn't, you guys wanna make one?	1.0 Do you mean like Google's Apps For Your Domain? If not, there isn't one yet. But I think it would be cool, making something like that.
1.0 I have no idea you fucking nerd.	1.0 report this guy... he's not the sorta ass we want here.

1.0 they should be categorised tagged. e.g. Countries Politics ...	1.0 actually, perhaps the posts themselves should be tagged...
1.0 I prefer to start new sections of concrete with my left foot, and step in them 2 n times. In fact, everything needs to be done 2 n times.	1.0 I feel bad for you if you do it 9 times...

1.0 Holy shit... I run up stairs, too. BUT, question: Do you take them two at a time? I can't seem to do it any other way. EOS 1.0 Me too	1.0 It seems like such a waste of time to do it any other way... PLUS? It's fucking fun !
1.0 Wait, am I the only person this happens to?	1.0 carbonated beverages hurt my throat. and i find the amount of sugar in most of them to be highly offensive. so basically I'm stuck with beer.
1.0 Well, nothing happens in Sacramento.	1.0 Given that I spend 4 to 5 months of every year there...I can agree.
1.0 What, the waste disposal unit at the bottom of the solar system's gravity well isn't good enough for you?	1.0 How do you know that's really a waste disposal unit?
1.0 As long as it doesn't come back, or give the aliens cancer..	1.0 Why do you hate Terra?
1.0 No, we only have so much stuff, and who knows what we'll be able to recycle in the future...	1.0 This is a fascinating point, and optimistic too. Will our generations landfills be a later generation's valuable resource? We can only hope so.
1.0 Shoot it into the sun.	1.0 Let's stick with the current trend an find someone else's sun to shoot it into, just in case.
1.0 coff remember the Microwave central of SimCity? EOS 1.0 coff remember THE SUN?	1.0 Ding ding! we have a winner!
1.0 We're already destroying Earth. Must we infect other parts of the universe with our garbage?	1.0 but the sun could consume the entire planet and be fine. surely our trash won't hurt it.
1.0 That's totally impossible and against all the known laws of physics. Ben Stein told me that. EOS 1.0 Well, as an economist, he'd know wouldn't he? Is not economics the most noble field of mathematics?	1.0 or the queen of the social sciences?
1.0 My thoughts exactly.	1.0 mmm...warsteiner. one of my favorite beers.
1.0 Does anyone know of any good talk radio online? Not just news, but anything where they have consistent shows about interesting stuff?	1.0 You looking for republican or democrat? Seems anymore these days, talk only falls into one of those two categories.
1.0 Other options?	1.0 Look at his name.
1.0 Dude. Get a laxative or something. Most people don't build 200 psi up when shitting... I know what sound you mean, though.	1.0 Ha ha, it doesn't happen ALL the time, but enough times that it's stuck in my mind.

1.0 FUCK IT! WE'LL DO IT LIVE!	1.0 This still amuses me.
1.0 Sucks my dick Doesn't bitch at me Likes bacon pizza Maybe not the ideal romantic partner, but those requisites will get pretty decent relationships I've found. EOS 1.0 I love bacon pizza! Although eating it makes me feel like I'm going to die soon. EOS 1.0 Indeed, me too. I always make sure to go excercise afterwards to feel better about myself. EOS 1.0 Just so I can understand... Is this bacon bacon, or Canadian bacon? If it's bacon bacon, is it crispy? EOS 1.0 This is bacon bacon, fried with ground peppercorns and some light creole seasoning for extra deliciousness. EOS 1.0 I'm breaking up with my girlfriend to date this pizza.	1.0 Wow, a post about romance just got completely hi jacked by bacon. Behold its power.
1.0 My wife EOS 1.0 On the same note, my girlfriend. She's wonderful!	1.0 Yes, she sure is!
1.0 You have shallow conversations around vectorfields?	1.0 Only in R2 p
1.0 Double clicking on the tab bar creates a new tab. I tend to use ctrl t. EOS 1.0 oh...cool. But sometimes I have so many tabs open there is no room to double click. But yea, cool trick, I didn't know that.	1.0 Press CTR Shift T and it will bring up the last web page your closed.

1.0 That fireproof safe is only fireproof for an hour or so. Unless that fire's out pretty quickly, your backup drive is still at high risk.	1.0 Well then the first thing I'd go for in a fire would be the fire proof safe... that seems silly.
1.0 The fire, obviously. EOS 1.0 The answer is you light a match first, then you light the lamp. Then you burn down Chicago. EOS 1.0 You save the cow?	1.0 Yes, please save my cow!

1.0 Let the idiots come, but they must thank the elite when we correct their grammar and spelling. EOS 1.0 Grammar errors speak for themselves.

1.0 Why learn in advance when you can just google any feature when the need arises?	1.0 I learned a great deal about photoshop this way.

1.0 Kool Aid, I wait until the man bursts through the wall and pours me a glass.	1.0 Kool Aid for me too, but I usually just wait for someone in robes to pour it.
1.0 Kool Aid, I wait until the man bursts through the wall and pours me a glass. EOS 1.0 OH YEAH!!!	1.0 OH YE Fuck.
1.0 Single malt scotch. I pour it in a glass in an arrogant fashion. EOS 1.0 I wish I could afford the kind of scotch I'd drink if I were going to drink scotch.	1.0 Speyburn and Tomatin are a good start. Less than 30 American pesos a bottle
1.0 Ice, whiskey.	1.0 I've been mixing it with some Perrier lately. It allows you to enjoy the taste of the whiskey without it knocking your ass out P.

1.0 You put the tap through a filter?	1.0 You can never be too careful when it comes to things you put into your body.
1.0 Single malt scotch. I pour it in a glass in an arrogant fashion. EOS 1.0 I wish I could afford the kind of scotch I'd drink if I were going to drink scotch. EOS 1.0 A good bottle of scotch might seem like a lot, but it's really only one or two weeks worth of bar tabs and it's much more satisfying. EOS 1.0 got a recommendation for a good brand?	1.0 I like the Balvenie 12 year.
1.0 Dr. Pepper. I prefer to drink from the can. EOS 1.0 Why anyone would drink carbonated prune juice is beyond me.	1.0 Me too. Good thing there is no prune juice in DP.
1.0 Dr. Pepper. I prefer to drink from the can. EOS 1.0 Why anyone would drink carbonated prune juice is beyond me.	1.0 That's an old urban legend. Dr. Pepper's website even discredits it.
1.0 Beer. I brew it.	1.0 Yeah, me too. Great stuff!
1.0 Sam's Club has a 300 queen sized memory foam mattress that is awesome.	1.0 WTF m8 cos i would have done that if i'd known, i bought a mattress in december

1.0 huh? why are people downvoting this story? EOS 1.0 Probably because it reeks of bad fiction. Either way, he's a dumbass.	1.0 No, I think he's a drunken asshole.
1.0 Shit, you got off lucky. In some jurisdictions, public urination will get you on the sex offender registry. EOS 1.0 No joke. I know it is that was in Oklahoma. That would have been awkward EOS 1.0 Engrish FAIL EOS 1.0 hahaha, that was awful. I won't edit it for humor purposes, but it is a sex crime in Oklahoma. Thanks	1.0 What isn't a sex crime in Oklahoma?
1.0 I win. The FBI raided me. That is not a joke either. EOS 1.0 You post lacks, what's the word, details. Spill the beans amstrdamordeath!	1.0 That means he loses.
1.0 This is the same type of reasoning people use about not wanting to sex or violence on TV movies or music. I have to give the same answer...turn the channel grandma.	1.0 A block user function is analogous to changing the channel it allows me to hide information I don't want to see without preventing others from seeing it.
1.0 Don't ask an anonymous internet forum. Ask friends and family. EOS 1.0 reddit is family too	1.0 Family notices if you vanish.
1.0 With computers Seriously though, I've got about six IRC channels up on the second monitor, and at least 100 Opera tabs open. I use the internet pretty massively.	1.0 Screenshot please, I want to see what that looks like. Remember to close the horse porn first though.

1.0 yep. and before i lose the backing i do the same thing with that. EOS 1.0 Ha! I do that too. Click. Click. Click. Click.	1.0 That's why the backing gets loose and breaks off! I have to yell at my gf for this constantly.
1.0 wtf? Jesus did not believe that he was the son of God. He preached about God his father.	1.0 But he was Jewish right? And Jew's do not believe that Jesus was the son of god.. How does that work?
1.0 Notice the 'Hot' link at the top of the 'New' page?... EOS 1.0 wonderful, that worked, thank you!	1.0 Happy to be of service...
1.0 Try digg?	1.0 I need to get rid of this pimple, any suggestions? ...Shotgun?
1.0 Could be worse. Could be an advertisement.	1.0 no, your mind automatically filters out advertisements. Check boxes draw attention
1.0 Try customising your display with Post it notes. It's quick, simple and requires minimal programming know how. You can even keep a selection of different colours and pictures to match your mood.	1.0 The ultimate solution for the ultimate slacker.

1.0 That's usefull info. We don't plan to bring much camping gear, but it could be a good alternative to hotels.	1.0 It's definitely cheaper, in a lot of places, and though it's not real camping, preferable to the quality of a cheap hotel motel.
1.0 Comic Sans. I can kill a typographer from twenty paces with it.	1.0 With the added bonus of being the most erotic of all fonts.
1.0 Sometimes I want to see what is on the regular front page, as if I wasn't logged in. Is there a way to do this? EOS 1.0 ehm ... log out ? most obvious answer ever imo	1.0 Then you lose ability to vote and comment

1.0 I just want the Reddit Ring that gives you free soda from the vending machine. EOS 1.0 The better ring is the one that gives you free Odwalla.	1.0 The best ring is in the receptionist's nipple....
1.0 Warheads. Ever since that little girl had her tongue cut open by the extreme sourness of the candy I haven't been able to find them anywhere.	1.0 Ah, Warheads.

1.0 brown sugar and butter, all mixed together.	1.0 See my other comment, just add marshmallows to the mix and nuke it up!
1.0 Alright, thanks... Seems like I'm making it right and it's just not my cup of tea... Back to creme brulee!	1.0 If you like the a custard pudding texture, but a more malleable and sweet flavor, you should also give panna cotta a try. It's like heaven in the mouth!
1.0 I don't see how you'll be able to easily remove it. It's got to tie into the drivetrain somehow and then there are the batteries. EOS 1.0 I was hoping someone would say it wouldn't even be necessary as the weight is not that great, but I keep reading how batteries are fucking heavy. EOS 1.0 Just use a long extension cord. Duh. EOS 1.0 I was hoping solar, but ok	1.0 Those are pretty expensive. It might actually be cheaper to buy a couple miles of shopcord.
1.0 that depends the amount of each. are we talking Armageddon in my front yard? and what freedoms am i giving up?	1.0 By giving up freedom, you relinquish the right to decide what you give up, how much you give up, and when it is appropriate to do so.

1.0 Just amazing how someone can go from a Paul supporter to an Obama supporter.	1.0 I'm still a Ron Paul supporter, but Obama would be a better president. When a charismatic atheist libertarian runs, he'll get my vote.
1.0 Not all libertarians would see it that way. EOS 1.0 Then I must assume they are either severely mislead or not really libertarians. Also, I've ammended my original post.	1.0 Mislead, most likely. There is no denying, however, that the rhetoric of universal healthcare tends to scare the shit out of them.

1.0 The things I find on reddit aren't interesting enough for anyone to say that. I find most of the awesome stuff on stumbleupon. EOS 1.0 Then, submit it to reddit.	1.0 I do. Most of the stuff I submitted is from stumble.
1.0 I've already gotten 4 downvotes in the first two minutes of posting this!! WTF?? EOS 1.0 Welcome to the new reddit. Enjoy your stay! EOS 1.0 I don't think they've changed the voting system, it's just that now everyone can see how many up down votes you have been receiving from your submits.	1.0 By New , I was comparing to the old reddit before the goddamned diggers started coming over here.
1.0 I mean lets say it's reset every week or so, maybe every month. I think it's a pretty good idea.	1.0 That'd put me out of business. I have a greasemonkey script to downvote everything on the new page.
1.0 Give me a fucking break. EOS 1.0 Like a smoke break, just more fun.	1.0 Oh! I see now. Thank you for the clarification.
1.0 Most of what gets posted is garbage or repeats. More needs downvoting than upvoting.	1.0 Most of what gets downvoted isn't garbage or repeats. Less downvoting would make these available for people to read... meaning less garabe and repeats, which is the point right.
1.0 getta bigga hammer!	1.0 Oh you, MrKlaatu.
1.0 A European guy will steal your girl! EOS 1.0 Not just an European guy, dude, but an Italian guy!!!	1.0 If she falls for an Italian, she was not worthy in the first place.

1.0 A European guy will steal your girl! EOS 1.0 Not just an European guy, dude, but an Italian guy!!! EOS 1.0 I'm not your dude, guy. EOS 1.0 I'm not your guy, buddy.	1.0 I'm not your buddy, mate.
1.0 The biggest lag I've noticed is when modding comments up or down. This only appears to be a problem on posts with a large amount of comments.	1.0 Thats exaclty my issue.
1.0 Also, on a Treo 700wx comment threads no longer appear with indentation which following a discussion difficult once there's a fork.	1.0 That's a big fork you, isn't it?
1.0 Ouch. Now there's a committment to pain.	1.0 at least he didn't say emacs
1.0 Hmm, that makes sense... I guess that would be why Mac software isn't as usable as other OSes, too... EOS 1.0 But everything just works . EOS 1.0 Yes, if you never want to make it work some other way... For example, there's no Cut for files in OS X... EOS 1.0 what'choo talkin' 'bout willis? apple x	1.0 Doesn't work.
1.0 I wasn't being serious, you know. Someone seems to have taken me serious, though.	1.0 You have no idea how many times I've heard that as a serious argument from Apple fanboys. Poe's law and all that.
1.0 Ouch. Now there's a committment to pain. EOS 1.0 no pain no gain p EOS 1.0 I hear you're right. It's a steep learning curve, but the payoff is huge.	1.0 I prefer vi vim, but it's the same with Emacs. They're both incredibly powerful editors, but learning how to use them it's not exactly easy, but the payoff is really big.
1.0 It's not a reference to Cowboy BeBop. And yes, I'm an asshole. I take it you called the number? Hahahahaha. EOS 1.0 No. I just remember your name and you being a dumbass asshole. No I didn't. I'm at work. I already thought you were an asshole, so why would I call? EOS 1.0 Maybe you wanted to know what I was wearing and where my hands were? EOS 1.0 So what the fuck is on the number then? Rick Rolled or whatever the hell it is?	1.0 Yes. Call it.
1.0 Yet another reason why the update was unnecessary, unwanted, and caused more problems than it solved. EOS 1.0 It's been this way for a long time, much longer than this update.	1.0 Hmmm... interesting. That means it's a recent update in the rules of the proxy.
1.0 As I type this, there are no comments but it says one comment. I believe this is because I wrote a comment and then deleted it.	1.0 Correct. Deleting comments does not decrement the n comments count.
1.0 what's a good IRC client?	1.0 I use pidgen or emacs.
1.0 One of my favorite places to chat with interesting people is a place called REAL LIFE.	1.0 Hey, I've heard of that. Isn't it two miles south of physical contact? Just west of restraining order?

1.0 What would help is what it looks like right now and what you are working with. And also, what appeals to do... Pictures man... pictures. EOS 1.0 I would have to Gimp the mess out of the photo to take out things that would cause identity theft big time consumer there.	1.0 Excuses, excuses. But seriously, even a picture that's half blacked out would be helpful, I'd think.
1.0 No doubt it's a problem and should be fixed. However, there's a workaround: set your comment threshold very low. Mine's set to 20, and I very rarely see comments lower.	1.0 Would that let me retain the option of replying to comments that are downvoted? Currently I think the threshold is 5, beyond that there isn't even a reply button.
1.0 Wrong! Conan, what is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women!	1.0 Hear hear! I concur!
1.0 I want to solve some great problem like the Riemann hypothesis, poverty, death, or libertarianism.	1.0 Solving death would create a much bigger problem. Libertarianism on the other hand...
1.0 Enough money to not need to work.	1.0 Probably easier to just get a job you enjoy...
1.0 I wish to sustain my curiosity and release any dogma I sustain. me EOS 1.0 I would want to someday relinquish my sense of ego.

1.0 I wish to sustain my curiosity and release any dogma I sustain. me EOS 1.0 You've summed up what I believe to be the keys to a life well lived.	1.0 I have only been jumping into my own subconscious for a short while now, and am excited to see what more i find.
1.0 True happiness, as far as I'm concerned, is either being under the influence of a large dose of opiates at all times...or dead. Either way: I feel no pain.	1.0 Well feeling no pain is a huge achievement. Either with the opiates or without. I've never found them to be truly effective at absolving real physical pain.
1.0 I wish to sustain my curiosity and release any dogma I sustain. me EOS 1.0 I would want to someday relinquish my sense of ego. EOS 1.0 Psychedelics offer their assistance in this matter.	1.0 Sometimes. Not for everybody and not always. But they sure do help those that helps.

1.0 yes. this presents a conundrum. EOS 1.0 Have you worked out an algorithm to calculate upvotes from increased exposure vs. downvotes out of spite for miscategorization?	1.0 I'm going with yes , but not going to share :P
1.0 Huh, I guess text within underscores becomes italicized . EDIT: You can escape your underscores with .	1.0 Oh, yeah, I forgot. Didn't even notice. I've escaped before, and forgot to this time.

1.0 I'm just curious. I was born and raised in Hampshire county, where do you live? EOS 1.0 I'm in Berkeley Co. Just a bit south, and a bit west of Martinsburg.	1.0 I played soccer against Martinsburg... they kicked our ass.
1.0 You sound like kind of a badass.	1.0 That almost made me cry a little...
1.0 Awesome, thank you. I''ll drop them a line shortly. EOS 1.0 Cool. I'm always surprised that they don't advertise more. All the states have them, but not many know about the program.	1.0 Yeah I definitely didn't know they existed, but it looks like its gonna be an awesome resource.
1.0 Really dedicated people compost and then bake it. Yes, it's really as much fun as it sounds like. EOS 1.0 i have never heard of such a thing. why bake? to sterilize? can you explain? EOS 1.0 Yes, to sterilize it. That way you can use it on fields that are destined to produce human edible produce. Particularly worrisome would be intestinal parasites and the like. EOS 1.0 any reference materials as to temps times? this could be useful in the future. although, i would prefer to have plant based not poo based. EOS 1.0 Anything over 212 for a minute or two is plenty, of course, you've got to evaporate the water before it reaches that internally... Seriously ew.	1.0 Well if you're a hardcore farmer you'll have your solar powered compost oven out in the compost field.

EOS 1.0 I'm sure he wasn't being anti semitic it's just that you can't include punctuation in your screenname. Jews: 911. Think about it?	1.0 I thought he might be trying to remind Jews that the Sabbath begins at 9:11 this week, but then I realized that it depends on latitude.
1.0 And I thought the Chewbacca defense was just making loud annoying sounds like a dying Chewbacca. EOS 1.0 There is no such thing as a dying Chewbacca.	1.0 He did die in ra salvatore's first star wars book, I was depressed for weeks.
1.0 I'd probably just drink a bottle of glue and spend my time in the hospital avoiding having to defend that ridiculous argument.	1.0 Hey, there's been a lot of that in this thread, but that was the one that made me laugh.
1.0 If it's worth downvoting, it's worth deleting.	1.0 deleting hurts the discussion. It leaves a hole. I'd rather downmod my post and drop an edit on it.

1.0 What does being Asian have to do with Chinese skill? Unless one has knowledge in characters from another Asian language that uses them, I fail to see how that matters.	1.0 For the same reason that a European would find it earlier to learn German or Italian than a non European would.

1.0 you can still go in the booth and vote for whoever. it has nothing to do with the test.	1.0 So what is the test for, just to get them thinking about the issues? Who makes the test, decides the questions, what policies are covered, etc?
1.0 To put it simply, everyone has the right vote	1.0 Which makes me agree with the quote that If voting changed anything, they would make it illegal
1.0 forums.xkcd.com fark.com bbspot.com jalopnik.com slate.com boingboing.net n4g.com and now I'm out of internets for the day too..	1.0 It's not a big truck
1.0 To all you chronic working redditors does the content seem like it is refreshing a bit less the last week or so?	1.0 It does. It's because no one checks the new page anymore, I think.
1.0 I do, but then I visit 4chan. And then I kill myself.	1.0 I wish I could visit 4chan at work, but I would probably get court martialed for that.
1.0 thanks to reddit, there's always new stuff! EOS 1.0 thanks to you . Seriously, thank you. EOS 1.0 We should throw him a party.	1.0 We could buy him some flowers.
1.0 Of course it's pointless unless you crave having the last word with some random stranger on the internet. EOS 1.0 I do EOS 1.0 Oh, really? EOS 1.0 Yes, really. EOS 1.0 We'll just have to see about that.	1.0 Indeed we will.
1.0 Make it 10 and you've got a deal.	1.0 Okay, but shipping not included.
1.0 Sources? No one asks the RIAA for sources when they claim they're losing billions to piracy .	1.0 so be better than them...
1.0 That would be nice, especially for those comments that people send as messages only and don't actually put them in the discussion.	1.0 Those already have a reply link.
1.0 Replying as a PM would cause confusion in the UI. It's easy enough to click the username and write a new PM. I vote the current behavior stays.	1.0 i think you're right. i downmodded myself.
1.0 Also, how about on private messages, don't have the report button where permalink is. I kept reporting someone thinking I was clicking permalink. EOS 1.0 Oh, hey! It doesn't actually report if you don't click 'Yes' afterward.	1.0 I see. Well played, Mr Paul.
1.0 Also, how about on private messages, don't have the report button where permalink is. I kept reporting someone thinking I was clicking permalink. EOS 1.0 Oh, hey! It doesn't actually report if you don't click 'Yes' afterward.	1.0 I know I've accidentally hit report and accidentally hit yes while aiming for no .
1.0 I'm incredibly unlikely to see it if it's posted to a self post. We get thousands every day	1.0 Ok, fair enough.
1.0 I dunno, Wasn't as good as the first one. Someone argue with me.	1.0 you Sr. are wrong! but i have yet to see the movie...
1.0 Why ask redditers? They are morons who like Family Guy and they don't like the first Futurama movie.	1.0 I like Family Guy and the first Futurama movie. I haven't seen Beast yet, though.
1.0 Because I wouldn't have bought it anyway had unauthorized downloading not been an option. EOS 1.0 Interesting point, thanks for sharing. What happens when you do find something that you like even though you imagined you wouldn't in the first place? EOS 1.0 Well I paid for radiohead's in rainbows. EOS 1.0 In Rainbows is the only CD I've bought in the last 5 years. EOS 1.0 Me too but more like 8 years. I buy vinyl when I see something cool though.	1.0 Up voted because I also buy vinyls. There is something about a vinyl's imperfections that make it... well... perfect.
1.0 I would gladly pay additional tax towards an endowment for the arts, here in California we already have the excellent University of California public schools that create many artists.	1.0 Education is different than paying artists until the grave.
1.0 Best point here	1.0 yeah, I don't really try to convince myself that it's ok cause that's bull.
1.0 It's like borrowing books from the library. EOS 1.0 Great point. Interestingly, most libraries have a annual charge paid to major publishers to compensate for the assumed lost sales because of such actions.	1.0 Really? I thought they just buy the books once. As far as I know this is how it's done in Europe. Do you have a source for that claim?
1.0 What entitles you to something you do not have permission to copy? The fact that you can get away with it?	1.0 Who is giving out the rights here?
1.0 Alpharetta here.	1.0 Oh dude you got it easy. I live out in Winder.
1.0 The internet. Edit: I laugh at your silly downmodding! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!	1.0 Silly redditor... there aren't any women on the internet.
1.0 Abortion clinics. EOS 1.0 at least you'll know they put out!	1.0 or were raped.
1.0 Why don't you just shut the fuck up for a day reqqit? You're not clever, you're not funny, you're not insightful.	1.0 Tell 'em how you really feel...
1.0 Why don't you just shut the fuck up for a day reqqit? You're not clever, you're not funny, you're not insightful.	1.0 Damn, you registered just to say that? Or are you reqqit saying that?
1.0 I'm a 19 year old female. Where do I go to meet interesting men?	1.0 ch00f, kxxb. kxxb, ch00f. My work here is done. You kids have fun.
1.0 I'm a 19 year old female. Where do I go to meet interesting men?	1.0 ...away from here?
1.0 I'm a 19 year old female. Where do I go to meet interesting men?	1.0 I presume that depends on your definition of interesting .
1.0 Religous girls any nasty in a good way man! They are ok since I'm sinning anyway, I'm going all out .	1.0 Then they tell their dad, threaten to cut off your balls, and send you creepy letters for a decade. No thanks.
1.0 No clubs or bars? Looks like eharmony is the answer.	1.0 They already rejected me
1.0 and they buy you shit all the time.	1.0 And make you meals, etc.
1.0 One word: Wolfshirt. The chicks will come to you .	1.0 I second the wolf shirt
1.0 I'm a 19 year old female. Where do I go to meet interesting men? EOS 1.0 Hey. Come around here often?	1.0 I don't know how to answer this without sounding like I don't have a life...
1.0 I must admit the men of reddit are rather interesting, but where does one find them in RL?	1.0 what is RL?
1.0 There are girls at furry conventions? What are they like?	1.0 Well, they are either just weird or nerdy, or very very sweet and personable. you can easily find both there.
1.0 Is it normally like camping, rock climbing, etc? I thought it looked free but I couldn't tell. EOS 1.0 Nope, its pay, but they do lots of outtings. Its to get out and meet people, other singles who are bored.	1.0 I'll have to check it out, it'd be worth the money thanks for the tip.
1.0 I'm a teetotaler. Don't drink. Never have. Never will.	1.0 Why's that? Just curious.
1.0 doesn't IIS only allow for 10 connections anyways?	1.0 You are thinking of PWS, which was limited by the desktop OS.
1.0 Yes, it's a joke. We did that yesterday. You guys catch this stuff quick. Is there a camera in our office?	1.0 Killjoy. :P
1.0 Yes, it's a joke. We did that yesterday. You guys catch this stuff quick. Is there a camera in our office?	1.0 Hahahaha! Almost pulled my leg on this one.
1.0 Yes, it's a joke. We did that yesterday. You guys catch this stuff quick. Is there a camera in our office?	1.0 there's a camera in the office bathroom...
1.0 Yes, it's a joke. We did that yesterday. You guys catch this stuff quick. Is there a camera in our office?	1.0 Yes. You know that little 'close me' doohickey in the top corner of your application window? Well, there is a camera embedded in there. Nice shirt, by the way.
1.0 I have some bad news...	1.0 Ahh what's a bit of water cooling between friends?
1.0 Yes, it's a joke. We did that yesterday. You guys catch this stuff quick. Is there a camera in our office? EOS 1.0 You guys should put justin.tv there in your office sometimes. EOS 1.0 They are right down the street from us, actually, we're friends with them	1.0 so then rock it, dude!
1.0 sorry, I should have precised most programmers from the majority I know, they need constant supervision if you don't want to blow your server. That was rude, sorry.	1.0 You've had a bad lot of programmers, I'm afraid. Generally speaking decent coders are more than aware of the issues facing system administrators.
1.0 There are an overwhelming number of ppl imprisoned for possession of marijauna. EOS 1.0 Which was against the law before the wave of laws inhibiting our freedoms came in. I see the point you're making, but I'm looking for something else.	1.0 I know, just sayin....
1.0 Allow me to translate the title: Wanted: confirmation bias.	1.0 If you say so StrangeQuark... I hope that confirms your own bias.
1.0 Also, if any of you know about a song that relates to screening for special education referals, i could use that too. Although I'm not sure if it exists... EOS 1.0 That's easy: They're Coming to Take Me Away , by Napoleon XIV	1.0 the good ole days or anything else by Wierd Al.
1.0 Electric company 1234!5!6789!10!11!12! EOS 1.0 I know exactly how that goes!	1.0 good. I forgot the lyrics. Can you help me out?
1.0 I'm genuinely curious what law enforcement types are thinking about today's civil liberties. Business as usual? No changes? EOS 1.0 My guess is that Reddit cops won't be a representative sample, but I'm also really interested to hear what they have to say.	1.0 Oh, I bet there are plenty of cops monitoring reddit...
1.0 It's almost as if there are thousands of people viewing the new page.	1.0 well done.
1.0 I downvote shit like this all the time.	1.0 and I'm ok with that. If it's shit, downvote. But ask reddits like this are pretty rare for me. But at least one instant downvote though on everything? Come on.
1.0 Quit your whining.	1.0 So ironic...
1.0 After 23 minutes you now have 2 down votes and 16 up votes. Considering the first few votes don't affect the article, how is this an issue? EOS 1.0 this is easily one of the crappiest of my reddit submissions. And yet, i've gotten more ups for this than any of the others. Blows my mind.	1.0 Perhaps the commonality is the low tone of reddit? Post more crap, sez I.
1.0 shit, see what I mean? 1 downvote almost instantly EOS 1.0 because this is stupid	1.0 oh yeah, right.
1.0 Its because the level of intelligence and maturity on reddit is slowly plummeting. EOS 1.0 lowest common denominator is bound to happen eventually.	1.0 doesnt mean we have to accept it.
1.0 Fail at what? I'm not trying for karma here I'm actually interested. EOS 1.0 Top of the damn list is the Tim Russert story.	1.0 Do you have subbreddits selected? Read above Mr. been on reddit for 7 days, asswipe.
1.0 Nine Eleven was an inside job.	1.0 he's on my friends list. His posts are, with few exceptions, the highlight of any topic.
1.0 911 is a joke in my town.	1.0 Points for unexpected dose of Public Enemy.
1.0 How'd you get those upside down d s?	1.0 How did you get a 360 degree rotated d ?
1.0 Because the only two possibilities are Windows and Ubuntu. EOS 1.0 Clearly not, hence the question mark.	1.0 I was questioning the assumption that as someone is not using windows, they are using Ubuntu.
1.0 I tip big, but I agree with you that it's absurd.	1.0 You can lessen the absurdity if you regularly frequent small establishments where they recgnize you and your big tipping behavior. Pretty soon your food whatever starts getting cheaper and better.
1.0 I was taught that 10 15 was what one was supposed to tip. That's what I have gone by my entire life. And I'm an old fart.	1.0 Maybe it's dependent on your region. I like in Texas and it's almost rule of thumb to leave them 20 . It might be different elsewhere
1.0 I tip extra because of the economy.	1.0 Exactly. Minimum wage workers are getting hit harder than I am.
1.0 I tip extra because of the economy.	1.0 Thank you. You're a mensch.
1.0 In Singapore, there is no tipping, and the service is still much better than any restaurant I've been to in America. Food is much better too. EOS 1.0 In Spain there is no tipping and the service is awful .	1.0 but the food is great!
1.0 Please come to my restraunt and tip me. It's only about one table a day that will tip 20 , and 50 would make my week.	1.0 maybe they just don't like weasels. But I have to say if my waiter was on fire I would tip him atleast 200
1.0 So for normal, non exceptional bar service, you don't leave any tip?	1.0 If the strength of the drinks are acceptable and the bartender is not rude then I might tip a dollar every few drinks.
1.0 I tip extra because of the economy. EOS 1.0 Tell your friends.	1.0 I do.
1.0 Must not get too many military types in there.	1.0 I dont get what you mean. My manager just got back from Iraq.
1.0 I'm not obligated to tip. I tip when I feel the person went out of their way to help me. Otherwise, they get a few pity dollars most. EOS 1.0 If you don't tip, you shouldn't eat out. All you're doing is robbing the people who serve you of their bread. Make your own goddamn food, asshole.	1.0 glad to see youre mature
1.0 Thanks for the info. Hello Alice from Dallas. I'm staying in Denison today, do you know where that is? EOS 1.0 Yes I do! In Texas speak, it's down the road a piece . Wanna stop by for a drink?	1.0 I may on my way back to San Antonio! Hey! Reddit friends. Hell yes!
1.0 You give them 4 for getting the food to you cold? Do they get 2 if its half eaten?	1.0 If they don't show up at all, he mails them 1.
1.0 Sad. I almost expected that.	1.0 The bill can still pass, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
1.0 Flickr's great for desktop backgrounds and such. I'm looking more for footage, though... video.	1.0 ohh, sorry. Thought you meant pictures.
1.0 bhal123 beat you to it by 5 minutes.	1.0 Well, one of them.
1.0 They're not sorted alphabetically, by number of users, or by date none of those would put the sewerhorse reddit on the first page. Maybe it's some measure of hotness?	1.0 I'm betting it has something to do with activity, perhaps in the form of posts, comments, and or votes.
1.0 They're not sorted alphabetically, by number of users, or by date none of those would put the sewerhorse reddit on the first page. Maybe it's some measure of hotness?	1.0 It's based on activity.
1.0 It says right at the top, Popular . You can also sort by New EOS 1.0 Wow, looking under the New section there is a lot of blogspam ads. I don't think 3 subreddits for couriers in mumbai is enough, actually.	1.0 Yeah, I want to know more about the couriers! Seriously though, there didn't used to be any. I guess the spammers were late catching on
1.0 I've never heard of anyone wearing boxers under their swimsuit, and it never occurred to me that anyone would do so until you posted this.	1.0 A major feature of swimwear is the fact that it is light, porous fabric that dries quickly. Sticking even light cotton underneath it seems like a bad idea.
1.0 Some flies make fly webs that capture spiders.	1.0 Only in Spore my friend.
1.0 Call an exterminator and nuke the bastards. I'd rather be impotent and have eye cancer than have black window spiders near me.	1.0 I'm completely serious, I'd rather have some weird cancer in like 30 years than spiders in my house
1.0 Call an exterminator and nuke the bastards. I'd rather be impotent and have eye cancer than have black window spiders near me.	1.0 As a former pest control person, I can tell you that you that chemicals don't work on spiders.
1.0 Adopt a rat to catch the spider...adopt a cat to catch the rat...adopt a dog to catch the cat..	1.0 I don't know why she swallowed the fly.
1.0 Adopt a rat to catch the spider...adopt a cat to catch the rat...adopt a dog to catch the cat.. EOS 1.0 ...and move out due to lack of space after moving in the wolf, the tiger, and the elephant.	1.0 Your elephant has some strange dietary habits.
1.0 They come checking you out in the bathroom because you're cute as a fruit fly. EOS 1.0 Best pickup line ever.	1.0 An also one of the most graphic. Cool.
1.0 Kill one, string it up as an example to the others.	1.0 Except the others would just eat it and breed more spiders.
1.0 Train the cat to kill spiders.	1.0 My spiders are trained to kill cats.
1.0 a truly american response.	1.0 Username appropriateness? Check.
1.0 I had a lot of bugs around my house. I also had a blowtorch. I still have the blowtorch, but significantly less bugs and propane. EOS 1.0 And furniture, perchance?	1.0 I meant around literally there were a lot of bugs circling the outside of my house. There are a few conspicuous scorch marks on some parts of the exterior.
1.0 I thought trnelson was utilizing irony to make the point of the OP.	1.0 Well, I was. I'm glad at least one person got it. Here's a little karma for you, friend.
1.0 No problem. Its nice to see someone intelligent on the internet :P	1.0 Alright, enough circle jerking, where's the fucking embittered arguments?!
1.0 Me? No. Go figure ...	1.0 Shut the hell up you. Everyone knows you're crazy. Oh. Wait.
1.0 I never read the responses to my comments.	1.0 I'm a hot chick and I live near you, want to have sex?
1.0 yay. agreed. lets make a no apostrophes club wont that be fun EOS 1.0 Thats the stupidest idea ever.	1.0 i cant agree more
1.0 I never read the responses to my comments. EOS 1.0 That's kind of sad you're precluding any chance at an actual conversation.	1.0 what if the whole purpose of the comment is to be a smartass? at least 50 of my comments fall into that category.
1.0 Meme is a dead meme. Who the fuck says meme anymore? God get with the times, it's now memizzle .	1.0 Why don't we just skip to flippity floppity floo?
1.0 In Soviet Russia... I can haz...	1.0 In Soviet Russia, haz can YOU.
1.0 Can i just ask why? EOS 1.0 No, you'll have to ask at least one other question.	1.0 How do they get the banana in the peel?
1.0 It's your Karma, which is the sum of votes on your articles such that a down vote is 1 and an up vote is 1.	1.0 Thank you, this has been bugging me for a while now. :p
1.0 If the glass is half full, then why the hell haven't you finished filling it up yet?	1.0 Alternatively: why the hell haven't you finished drinking it yet? Alternatively: who the hell drank half my beer?
1.0 Are you a female perchance? EOS 1.0 Get away from me... EOS 1.0 The obvious solution here is to just go drinking with him.	1.0 It's against my religion. And he never asked me to go.
1.0 This one. Hey, help me out here.	1.0 Don't worry, 7 still beats alot of what I see from the Neocons.
1.0 in upvote or downvote?	1.0 Either, both, or neither.
1.0 taking old harddrives and creating a raid volume	1.0 And then filling that array with...?
1.0 Circuit Bending!	1.0 At the risk of sounding dumb, what is circuit bending?
1.0 What resource did you use for instruction? This is something I've always wanted to do but I'm not sure where to start.	1.0 If you have a local home brew supply shop, they'll sell you a kit and enough reading material to get you started.
1.0 0 to Professional Programmer in 24 hours!	1.0 I consider myself to be a proffesional googler :P
1.0 Testing router ish OS es! :P Openwrt, m0n0, pfsense et al :P EOS 1.0 Find me an OS that works with my router! Or a router that works with my OS! I want my openwrt! EOS 1.0 I've told you a million times, get a SBC. EOS 1.0 I can't find any!	1.0 oh shut up. :P
1.0 Wouldn't a coca plant be even funner? EOS 1.0 Yes, because the comedy never stops once the DEA is after you.	1.0 Like an episode of Benny Hill.
1.0 What resource did you use for instruction? This is something I've always wanted to do but I'm not sure where to start. EOS 1.0 Papazian's The Complete Joy of Homebrewing is a fantastic book. It's accessible to the newbies and a phenomenal reference for the more experienced brewer. One warning: brewing is addictive.	1.0 Thanks fore the warning. I'll try to check out that book, too.
1.0 Thank you for your detailed response! Incredibly helpful.	1.0 No problem. I've had fun with it, so it's nice to be able to share.
1.0 Carefully organizing and recatagorizing my porn by genre	1.0 How do you handle tags? Symlinks?
1.0 I logged in to link to that site.	1.0 Well, seems like you may log out again
1.0 Where's the affordable green housing going to come from? Are you going to pass out olive drab pup tents?	1.0 I'll put that on the list right between the community owned bulldozer and the low cost land leases.
1.0 I'll live there if it'll wait 4 years for me to complete my training and be located somewhere in the pacific northwest where my wife can get a teaching position.	1.0 On the other hand, she could be the teacher for the 30 some families there, and have complete indoctrinational control over all of Gnutown. Think about it.
1.0 You'll need to let us know where around here is.	1.0 I'm writing this in Arkansas, though this sort of settlement could be done most anywhere.
1.0 I used to read that, but the constant conservative slant began to annoy me.	1.0 I think of it as a rich new yorker slant rather than straight out conservative.
1.0 My brother in law remembers his birth, or so he says.	1.0 That would be horrifying to remember.
1.0 My brother in law remembers his birth, or so he says.	1.0 He's probably full of shit.
1.0 Someone told me about a place called reddit...	1.0 I don't even remember that. My first memory is showing up here.
1.0 That is to say, unbearable pain and torture. Followed by a profound sense of loss. EOS 1.0 followed by being pressed to the comforting breasts of the very woman who authorized the torture.	1.0 which were 'bitten' for their betrayal
1.0 it's gonna be like firefox christmas. wooo ooo o	1.0 Unfortunately, we've all been looking in our parent's closets for weeks before... we know the presents already, we just have to fake it. Have I become that pessimistic already? Sheesh.
1.0 one page in and you Rick Roll me?!?! You bastard...	1.0 I'm so sorry.
1.0 one page in and you Rick Roll me?!?! You bastard... EOS 1.0 I don't get it. Then again, the scribd reader never renders anything right for me.	1.0 look at page 5 and read the quotes...
1.0 one page in and you Rick Roll me?!?! You bastard... EOS 1.0 I don't get it. Then again, the scribd reader never renders anything right for me. EOS 1.0 There's a PDF at www.filedropper.com gstepl	1.0 Yeah I know I found it already. :P
1.0 I'd like to nominate you for Most Obscure Rickroll 2008.	1.0 Aww, shucks. But I'm guessing the prize isn't worth much and or is actively harmful to my health.
1.0 I find it a bit odd that you go on for ages and pages without a paragraph break.	1.0 Indeed. Pong.
1.0 I just browsed it. Is this an attempt at a modern Ulysses ?	1.0 God, no. I respect Ulysses too much to attempt that.
1.0 I actually do some of those things on long drives to work or University.	1.0 I ride a motorcycle and would rather you concentrated on the driving thanks!
1.0 So... 5 more than the average American?	1.0 up to 15 more in bad cases... gotta love socialized services sometimes :
1.0 try TED for geeky matters, i dont know about the instructional part though	1.0 I second this. TED Rocks!!
1.0 Irony at its best?	1.0 Quite possibly.
1.0 Feedback link is below, toolshed	1.0 Feedback probably wouldn't respond to this the best bet is a greasemonkey script.
1.0 I think it has less to do with our generation, and more with arguing on the internet in general. Though I will say, facebook groups and youtube are especially bad. EOS 1.0 And IMDb. sigh	1.0 I forgot about that. IMDB requiring registration to view the threads was one of the best things that happened to me.
1.0 Discussions on Facebook are rarely intelligent.	1.0 I was hoping to create one, for once. I failed.
1.0 I've long wondered if Canada would be better off if we isolated ourselves. We have the resources, the man power, the educators and the skilled labourers. Am I missing anything?	1.0 No. My thoughts exactly, but we're owned it seems.
1.0 I've long wondered if Canada would be better off if we isolated ourselves. We have the resources, the man power, the educators and the skilled labourers. Am I missing anything?	1.0 It wont happen while you have America wearing you like an asshat
1.0 I think it has less to do with our generation, and more with arguing on the internet in general. Though I will say, facebook groups and youtube are especially bad. EOS 1.0 almost every youtube discussion in some way comes down to the most racist, hate filled filth you could imagine. I guess that's what happens when it's nothing but anonymous teenagers. EOS 1.0 Actually for obscure, more intellectual music, the comments on Youtube are actually pretty good. EOS 1.0 stfu faggot no their not	1.0 No you shut the fuck up faggot!
1.0 Specifically it's an old Van de Graaf generator. Ebay just seems like the wrong site to sell it on. EOS 1.0 ok, got pics? condition? how much do you want for it? EOS 1.0 I don't think you should encourage people to use reddit's forums for spam. Asking about websites is one thing, touting for customers is another.	1.0 The submitter has posted in this subreddit before, asking where to donate surplus electronics. He passed my spam filter.
1.0 Opera 9.5! Who needs Firefox? EOS 1.0 Everyone who doesn't use Opera 9.5.	1.0 Or Internet Explorer holds in laughter
1.0 No it's not okay, continue buying petroleum from giant oil corporations!!	1.0 I'd prefer to buy ethanol from megacorp agricultural consortiums subsidized by the government.
1.0 Its ok with me! One less car on the roads.	1.0 What about the environmental cost of all the new parts to repair that car?
1.0 Doesn't look like it.	1.0 hmmm said so a minute ago
1.0 I started learning Welsh a while back, all I remember now is Awyren is airplane and gwraig is girl... that isn't very useful at all...	1.0 apparently you didn't learn how to say 'mile high club.'
1.0 I'd recommend a plane, but I've heard swimming can be rewarding too.	1.0 When you add up the time spent waiting in line, being detained, and having your cavities searched, swimming usually ends up faster.
1.0 Why not Canada? We're still free!	1.0 Don't worry, we'll get to you soon enough....
1.0 I assume you mean better as in, it's easier to be better than one of Coldplay's musician's than one of Radiohead's , right?	1.0 That's the effect I'm going for, kinda yeah absolutely
1.0 I was in Cardiff once, asking for directions and some guy answered me in english and I had no clue what he was saying.	1.0 the welsh talk like yoda
1.0 First thing to do is learn the language. EOS 1.0 and meet a girl, although you sure you wanna go from one surveillance state into a worse one?	1.0 Mainly just need a change of pace. Know plenty of people on the island, and don't really have anything holding me here in America. Figure why not
1.0 Why not Canada? We're still free! EOS 1.0 Dont know anyone there... And it's Canada. Did you not read I'm from Texas? EOS 1.0 Now I understand why you're moving. Tired of jesus?	1.0 Hahaha is it sad that your stereotype of Texas is completely true? It sucks being an Atheist in Texas. Very unforgivable
1.0 Reddit has ads, they are blocked by your adblocker. You're welcome. EOS 1.0 I'm not so sure that a few very small ads can generate the income to support a site like this.	1.0 Websites are cheap. It's not like building and maintaining an actual building.

1.0 An old hardcover Qur'an, bilingual probably. EOS 1.0 Why contaminate a fresh world with religion?	1.0 Contaminate? Wake up, if you don't want religion, keep humans away. It's as simple as that.
1.0 Did you make that up? EOS 1.0 Yeah...I need to stop commenting on reddit after I've been drinking...it produces strange results.	1.0 On the contrary, that is the best time to comment.

EOS 1.0 I've never done this, but I hear working at the movie theater is pretty cool, because you get to see all the new movies early and for free.	1.0 Sunday Thursday nights during the summer at my local theater nobody checks tickets so you can just walk in. Cheapest dates ever.
1.0 That does seem kinda far away from him.	1.0 Sure, but maybe he has friends here. Hey, just trying to be helpful.
1.0 I use those little opportunities to bet on it before googling.	1.0 But not money...
1.0 1. I can't imagine why anyone would. 2. I can't imagine why Obama would ask.	1.0 It's easy for Obama to ask. And he probably knows that almost none of his supporters would actually give to Hillary. Words are cheap.
1.0 1. I can't imagine why anyone would. 2. I can't imagine why Obama would ask. EOS 1.0 Yeah same here. I can't see why citizens should pay for ads that they probably don't want to watch in the 1st place.	1.0 Cause we are all in this together, aren't we?

1.0 No, not vital, but both parties must be in agreement on where the lines are drawn and commit to honoring those lines.	1.0 I agree. And that basically comes down to openness and communication: The one thing there can't be enough of in any relationship.
1.0 Yes. Women get all emotionally attached when you have sex with them.	1.0 Probably depends who you talk to, I've observed the opposite more frequently.

1.0 Tina Fey. EOS 1.0 My wife actually reminds me of a hot mexican Tina Fey. She doesn't look like Fey but she has the personality and humor. EOS 1.0 Then I'll settle for your wife. EOS 1.0 Sorry brother I'm keeping this one.	1.0 We can have thumb wrestling to decide that'd be cool.
1.0 That is absolutely! a keeper, good find my man.	1.0 I'm also curious as to what percent magic find enabled you to get that awesome item to complete your set. Unless you got it from a cow run...
1.0 If it ended it divorce , would there be a legal consequence? If not, are you really as legally bound as a married couple? Asking honestly. EOS 1.0 Yes. Common law relationships in Canada are treated similarly as divorces, from what I understand.	1.0 Then you better get married, as you can get a pre nup agreement with marriage!
1.0 Are we talking about anal?	1.0 we're always talking about anal.
1.0 How about as a celebration of that commitment?	1.0 I do see a celebration or other type of public acknowledgment being relevant, fun, and beneficial.
1.0 Tina Fey. EOS 1.0 My wife actually reminds me of a hot mexican Tina Fey. She doesn't look like Fey but she has the personality and humor. EOS 1.0 Then I'll settle for your wife. EOS 1.0 Sorry brother I'm keeping this one. EOS 1.0 Where can I find hot mexicans that like gringos? Honestly I live in LA, but all my circles run white and asian.	1.0 In southern New Mexico. Gringos are in the minority so we're mildly exotic.
1.0 I kept expecting the story to end with Then my mom got scared......	1.0 Damn I wish I had thought of that.
1.0 am i the only one who noticed a certain military engagement crazy jumping into things tendancies theme to these stories?	1.0 Those are the stories that are the most fun to tell.
1.0 Ya, sure.	1.0 I am looking at my wife right now, no need to try and convince you, I know what happened.
1.0 Never put a cat in your underpants. EOS 1.0 There goes Benjamin Franklin's afternoon.	1.0 In his case, a warning about attaching a kite to his underpants wouldn't go amiss, either.
1.0 While you're on the second amendment pssst, someday we will invent weapons that make guns look silly. Include all future weapons.	1.0 they didn't say guns , they said arms . Which includes, I believe, all types of weaponry. With that being said we have every right to bear all types of weaponry.
1.0 I am! Lagunitas IPA and Rogue Dead Guy pale ale! And PBR for backup :D	1.0 IM ON THE PBR NOW !!!!
1.0 That's a bit of an oversimplification. If I post a story that gets 200 net votes my Karma doesn't go up 1:1.	1.0 Yeah, one of my stories actually has more points than my karma, let alone what the total points should be.
1.0 Didn't you hear him? Look in the code, noob. It's all there. Yeesh. He doesn't have time to simply give you an answer. RTFM. Gawd.	1.0 Ha, yeah it looks like I'm losing points for being curious here.
1.0 Yeah I was talking about the karma normalization part. Now that I know what it's called, I'll dig deeper and see if I can find something. EOS 1.0 There is no normalisation of karma. it really is all right there, I don't know why everyone is trying to make it more complicated	1.0 It's because we don't witness a 1:1 ratio of karma to points from submissions, but possibly that is a caching effect or certain votes failing validation.
1.0 when the question is a silly one or an attempt at trolling.	1.0 looks as if you have been a victim of teh internets trolls.
1.0 Right now.	1.0 when the day ends in 'y'

1.0 It used to be peanut butter and balogna. I outgrew that... EOS 1.0 My mom still likes peanut butter and onion. At her nursing home they think it's because of the Alzheimer's but she's had eaten those as long as I can remember. EOS 1.0 Can she only get the big yellow ones? I heard there is a shortage of the white ones.. cause of the war.	1.0 Well, apparently tying one to your belt was the fashion at the time.
1.0 The “Schwartzkoff” Chicken, Ham, Swiss, Mozzarella, Lettuce, Mayo, Onion, Sweet amp Sour Sauce melted together.	1.0 there is absolutely nothing unusual about that sandwich
1.0 Mayo, Turkey, and Cranberry EOS 1.0 thats not unusual, you can buy those in the shops here.	1.0 And they're awesome...
1.0 Use the google cache.	1.0 Well the other thing is I am not necessarily wanting a journal article. Sometimes I just want to find a website.
1.0 She does it with me, why hide it? EOS 1.0 I was going to leave a comment that said She does it with me too but then I decided not to. EOS 1.0 I was going to leave a comment that said, She does it with me but then I got hungry. Hey! Pizza guy!	1.0 I can't get her to do it with me no matter how much she does it with me. But I guess that's a different problem altogether.

1.0 I never smoked unless somebody shared with me. I'm curious how do you usually get yours?	1.0 You buy it...
1.0 I never smoked unless somebody shared with me. I'm curious how do you usually get yours?	1.0 Judging by all the inquiries I get, you ask people that look like they might smoke weed if you know where they can buy some, until someone does.
1.0 She did that over a little weed? What a bitch.	1.0 Hopefully she won't fuck up the kids too badly. Edit: I got downmodded for hoping the kids aren't fucked up? Do you want them to be fucked up?
1.0 Absolutely not. She hates the cigarettes, which I'm trying to quit, but she shares my affection for the other thing. EOS 1.0 gay porn?	1.0 Precisely. I was too embarrassed to say it.
1.0 Can you run for senate, buddy?	1.0 I can! However, Janet Napolitano is going to run for McCain's Senate seat in two years. I'm going to try to run for State level candidacy in about six years.

1.0 mmm, but what about the fat girl angles internet disease? you'd get false positives EOS 1.0 No reason you can't change your vote after you meet her, or take into account later information.	1.0 That works, but no guarantee she'll ever trust you enough to meet her. That's one of the reason I like the meetups, because it's a 'safe' social situation.
1.0 No fatties. Or at least let me filter them out easily. EDIT: Looks like from the downvotes we have a couple of fatties here.	1.0 I wish it worked this way in public places too.
1.0 Busy professional women also tend to use online dating. At least several that I have known have used it. EOS 1.0 Riiiiight... because lord knows they aren't meeting anyone at work, at conferences, through friends family etc. Yeah, they are online only because they are too busy...yeah...	1.0 I said that I know, not that you know. Anecdotes are not evidence, granted but you are basically calling me a liar.
1.0 you can always just wait for a movie, or did australians lose patience along with civility when the convicts started to breed, OH SNAP	1.0 Surely you should be aware that there are more Chinese in OZ than descendants of convicts. We are very patient in fact, we love you long time.

1.0 Couldn't they just upload the movie onto an Aussie manufacturers server and make their copies there?	1.0 Wait shit can we do that?!
1.0 Couldn't they just upload the movie onto an Aussie manufacturers server and make their copies there?	1.0 common waitstaff do not have the scribe skills to illuminate such fine works
1.0 They want to minimize advertising cost. If a movie flops in the US, they'll never show it abroad, and so they won't occur any costs abroad.	1.0 incur They still advertise here at the same time.
1.0 Until the RIAA sues you	1.0 Correct, Usually the thrill of living dangerously requires this thing called danger.
1.0 Until the RIAA sues you EOS 1.0 the recording industry ass. of america is now doing the job of the motion picture ass. of america?	1.0 The recording industry ass of america. That's what I'm calling it from now on.
1.0 Couldn't they just upload the movie onto an Aussie manufacturers server and make their copies there? EOS 1.0 I thought you aussies didn't have the bandwidth?	1.0 We used 3 months supply so andrewinmelbourne could make this Reddit submission.
1.0 They need time to do the translation. EOS 1.0 From English to Australian English?	1.0 Not from English, from American.
1.0 They need time to do the translation. EOS 1.0 From English to Australian English? EOS 1.0 it takes time to add all the G'day Mates.	1.0 And remove all the 'yeee haw's, clearly.
1.0 They need time to do the translation. EOS 1.0 From English to Australian English? EOS 1.0 it takes time to add all the G'day Mates.	1.0 they have to take out all the Steve Irwin jokes....
1.0 Until the RIAA sues you EOS 1.0 the recording industry ass. of america is now doing the job of the motion picture ass. of america? EOS 1.0 Motion pictures usually have RIAA music on them it actually wouldn't be too surprising to see the RIAA sue for movie downloads.	1.0 you don't even need a computer to be sued by the RIAA

1.0 This is just payback for Fosters. EOS 1.0 C'mon. You drink Bud, you were asking for it. EOS 1.0 I never drink bud! Portland, OR is the microbrew capitol of the world, thank you very much.	1.0 I would love to visit Oregon some day, I always hear good things.
1.0 This is just payback for Fosters. EOS 1.0 C'mon. You drink Bud, you were asking for it. EOS 1.0 I never drink bud! Portland, OR is the microbrew capitol of the world, thank you very much.	1.0 Agreed 100 , but Portland's the exception not the rule. Unfortunately the more populated states, eg Cali and NY, love Bug, MGD and Sam Adams.
1.0 46.1 . Down from last month's 46.8 . i think i do make progress cutting back on procrastinating.	1.0 What percentage of your work day do you spending figuring out what the percentage of your work day that you spend on reddit is?

1.0 50 75 but my job entails sitting around in a small room waiting for 911 calls to come in. EOS 1.0 Do you ever get a call that comes in and you're like I JUST read about something similar on reddit!	1.0 No that's never happened to me. But the population I serve is pretty small and very healthy.
1.0 Hey! That can be done politely! I want to best of you so others see how it is done... EOS 1.0 I thought that was polite. I was simply suggesting another place that trnelson might look for an answer. My apologies if this was confusing.	1.0 He's complimenting you on being polite.
1.0 If you created a number system to base pi, then wouldn't pi be expressed as 10? EOS 1.0 Hmmmm... then how would our normal base 10 value of 1 be expressed?	1.0 I think that would still be 1. But base 10 value of 2 would be trickier.
1.0 I'm afraid that's beyond me. Maybe one of the Reddit mathematicians can supply the answer. EOS 1.0 The answer, I imagine, is that you can't have a number system base pi, or at least one that's anything like usual place systems.	1.0 I agree it would be different from conventional systems and horribly impractical for everyday purposes, but it may not be impossible and it might have some special uses.
1.0 Google reader with about 150 feeds.	1.0 I just looked and was surprised to learn I have 292. My god. This is kind of sad.
1.0 Use a straight razor. EOS 1.0 Yeah, if you really hate to shave, go with a straight razor. Makes sense to me... sarcasm	1.0 Treat it with respect. Keep it sharp, and it will love you in return.
1.0 What does the aftershave do? I thought that was a gimmick.	1.0 It makes you smell like an Italian.
1.0 Will olive oil almond oil be ok? Do you need to moisturize beforehand? EDIT: That sounded vaguely sexual, I know.	1.0 You should wet your face beforehand..
1.0 sandpaper... ... you pansy	1.0 A guy at 3M actually invented a facial sanding system to replace shaving. He sanded his face until the day he died...
1.0 Try Linux. EOS 1.0 i don't know how.	1.0 It's much easier to use than you'd expect. Go to ubuntu.com download the cd and play around.
1.0 Run xp in a vm and use ubuntu 64 bit as your base os.	1.0 Don't even bother with VM, I've yet to find anything crucial Wine can't handle.
1.0 Silly! What if the kids read that on Reddit? Then it won't work.	1.0 Good point. Hey stupid egging kids...knock it off or I'm telling your mom! There, that should take care of it.

1.0 The remaining four books of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy. EOS 1.0 ... by another director.	1.0 You got that right.
1.0 Snow Crash, The Diamond Age, or any Stephenson book really. Except each would require a trilogy of movies.	1.0 Snow Crash would kick so much ass as a movie.
1.0 Finnegans Wake	1.0 If that would ever happen, it would necessarily be the greatest movie ever.
1.0 The Foundation series by Asimov or even something about the robots series	1.0 And not anything like the insults to Asimov that the movie versions of The Bicentennial Man and I, Robot were.
1.0 The remaining four books of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy. EOS 1.0 I'd rather see the first one done better.	1.0 Agreed. They have no business making the rest until they get the first one right...
1.0 Stranger in a Strange Land . Although Hollywood did such a piss poor job with Starship Troopers , it's probably better if they don't make it. EOS 1.0 would not be possible, would be considered way too 'anti religion'. would be fucking burning crosses at the theatre and shit. EOS 1.0 Its anti religion? I have to check it out then.	1.0 If you an anti religion book by Heinlein try Job: A Comedy of Justice.
1.0 The Man in the High Castle by Phil Dick.	1.0 Done right, it would be awesome.
1.0 The Man in the High Castle by Phil Dick.	1.0 meh, I'd much rather see The Grasshopper Lies Heavy.
1.0 I was gonna say Fountainhead, but its difficult to translate into a 2 3 hour audio visual experience. Anyone hear of a good screenplay based on Rand's work?	1.0 Anthem could be done pretty straightforward.
1.0 The Bible. Unabridged. I'd get a kick out of the hardcore religious folks lining up to see a 34 hour long movie. EOS 1.0 I'd do it as a comedy. The begats chapter would run 45 seconds long.	1.0 Nothing but vaginas spewing babies?
1.0 The Bible. Unabridged. I'd get a kick out of the hardcore religious folks lining up to see a 34 hour long movie. EOS 1.0 With the hardcore sex scenes uncut.	1.0 And Shempo begat whatsit and whojig begat someone and...

The Bible kicks ass. There's so many awesome parts.	1.0 The Book of Revelation alone would rock, especially done with massive CGI. We could finally get to see what a seven headed, ten horned beast looks like.
1.0 The Otherland series by Tad Williams.	1.0 Was gonna say the same thing myself.
1.0 The Otherland series by Tad Williams.	1.0 I'd be happy with any Williams series.

1.0 The Bible. Unabridged. I'd get a kick out of the hardcore religious folks lining up to see a 34 hour long movie. EOS 1.0 Heston is dead, unfortunately. EOS 1.0 Depends on your point of view.	1.0 Dead my ass, in 1980 he is still alive.
1.0 Ice Station. I could care less about other Matthew Reilly books, but a dude gets eaten by an Orca in this book.	1.0 Came here to say the exact same thing. Fucking good shit motherfucker!

1.0 that's whats likely to happen Really?	1.0 YA RLY
1.0 Lord of the Rings. The movies could never have matched the books in awesomeness. Still regret watching them EOS 1.0 I actually thought the Lord of the Rings movies were awesome, on par with the books.	1.0 They were good movies but certainly not on par with the books.
1.0 Lord of the Rings. The movies could never have matched the books in awesomeness. Still regret watching them EOS 1.0 I actually thought the Lord of the Rings movies were awesome, on par with the books. EOS 1.0 Agree. They did a hell of a job, even though they left out Tom Bombadil...	1.0 Tom Bombadil would have required his own film.
1.0 Children of Men. A damn near perfect story. Despite its word of mouth popularity, the film bore little resemblance to the book.	1.0 There was a book?! Dammit, why don't I know these things?
1.0 Starship Troopers.	1.0 I wish he hadn't named it Starship Troopers. The book and the movie have nothing in common.
1.0 The Golden Compass...what a disappointment.	1.0 I totally agree, terrible movie.
1.0 iRobot issac asimov is pretty pissed right about now.	1.0 pretty sure asimov would have loved the references to converse and fedex throughout the movie.
1.0 No Country for Old Men.	1.0 as good as the movie was, the book was better. in terms of wishing it was never made, i am not sure i'd go that far
1.0 I'm glad you correctly pointed out that Clancy's written works are classified as books instead of books . EOS 1.0 I consider Clancy's work to be more of a fictionalized encyclopedia.	1.0 A little too patriotic for my taste, too.
1.0 I'm glad you correctly pointed out that Clancy's written works are classified as books instead of books . EOS 1.0 I consider Clancy's work to be more of a fictionalized encyclopedia.	1.0 But we already have Conservapedia.
1.0 Battlefield Earth. Actually, I wish it had never been a book either.	1.0 as strange as this is to type: the movie was better than the book
1.0 Daredevil. Not a 'book' per se, as I'm sure the book snobs will point out. EOS 1.0 It's not a novel, but it's certainly a book. Thanks, Affleck, for ruining one of my favorite heroes. EOS 1.0 Yeah, DD has always been my favorite. I think I'm still angry to this very day over that pile of shit they called a movie .	1.0 I don't know what I was even thinking going to see that in theaters, oh naive youth
1.0 Yup that fuckin movie sucked. I would say someone should try again but, fool me once...	1.0 ....shame on.......shame on you............... fool me cant get fooled again.
1.0 Anything biblical. EOS 1.0 Intolerant much? EOS 1.0 Pot, Kettle, Black. EOS 1.0 Barking up the wrong tree here. EOS 1.0 Or could I be pissing up the wrong rope? Using the wrong analogy in the wrong situation is phun!	1.0 I don't know, my dog won't hunt.

1.0 Can you remove files as soon as the intended recipient has got them?	1.0 There is a delete code, actually. But I'd suggest yousendit.com instead.
1.0 Rapidshare is rather horrible to download from, without a paid account. MediaFire is far nicer to download from.	1.0 Tried it, worked a treat! Thanks!
1.0 I was thinking of avoiding the expensive cities. So, how expensive are those?	1.0 Tokyo, very much so. Hong Kong is also, but cheaper than Tokyo. Bangkok is very cheap relatively.
1.0 It's crap quality. It's an iron on not a screenprint. I'd avoid them. Try customink.com instead. EOS 1.0 Yeah, go for CustomInk. You can even get American Apparel Ts printed.

1.0 A more obscure but still somewhat recent flick is Grizzy Man by Hertzog. It's decent but you will still be influenced by and think about it years later.	1.0 Werner Herzog is my favorite documentarian. Check out his White Diamond if you haven't yet.
1.0 Your handle actually reminded me of another good movie reco. Young Frankenstein. Mel Brooks. Original set. AB Normal. Awesome.	1.0 ... Seda GIVE!?
1.0 Repo man... Because there is no difference between UFOs and time machines.	1.0 the awesome sound track.
1.0 On the other end of the scale, try 2001: A space odessey for a sci fi classic. Be warned though, very... very... slow... pace... EOS 1.0 Oh come on it wasn't THAT slow. Heck, I sat through the whole thing as a hyperactive 12 year old.	1.0 Even the half hour of colors at the end? Just how hyperactive were you?
1.0 Palahniuk said he liked Uhls ending better. He did not say the movie was better than the book.	1.0 I stand corrected.

1.0 Smoke weed instead. You won't regret it so much in the morning.	1.0 Unless you wake up in a holding cell. However, that's the only real drawback that I'm aware of.

1.0 They don't. The problem is nobody knows when to stop and there is a thin line between feeling good and getting shitfaced. EOS 1.0 I know where to stop. I just decide not to.	1.0 That's because your decision making abilities are impaired.
1.0 Smoke weed instead. You won't regret it so much in the morning. EOS 1.0 The worst thing that'll happen to you when you smoke is eating an entire bag of Doritos and then passing out while playing video games. Drinking? Not so much. EOS 1.0 That is also the best thing that'll happen, which is why smoking weed is overall a pretty dull experience.	1.0 Its like anything else. You get out of it, what you put into it. I do my best web design slightly altered.

1.0 I don't understand the allure of drinking at all. EOS 1.0 I love to drink but can't grasp the allure of smoking pot. EOS 1.0 I agree with the pot aspect as well. What's the point? EOS 1.0 For me, laughter.	1.0 I found LSD to be quite funny back in the day.
1.0 yeah, except a good majority of pot heads tend to be lazy, dirty, and stupid.	1.0 no those are bums..
1.0 yeah, except a good majority of pot heads tend to be lazy, dirty, and stupid.	1.0 Thats a generalization though. Its almost like saying all blacks are dirty, lazy and stupid. If one is not acceptable, why is the other?
1.0 yeah, except a good majority of pot heads tend to be lazy, dirty, and stupid.	1.0 There is also a huge difference between being 16 and doing it to be cool. And being a grown adult doing it to relax.
1.0 I said a good majority, I by no means said all.	1.0 True, I'm just saying that it's quite possible to smoke and not become the dreaded 'stoner burnout'.
1.0 I said a good majority, I by no means said all.	1.0 Most all of the pot heads I know are highly intelligent, at least half with degrees or workin towards PhD's. They aren't dirty either.
1.0 I said a good majority, I by no means said all.	1.0 Right. And most Jews have all of the money, most Gypsies are thieves, and most Hispanics are here illegally. They're not stereotypes if you qualify them with most .

1.0 He invited you to visit him? Call me crazy for asking, but are you female?	1.0 Yes. Although I have to think that at least 50 of the tech support callers are also female...maybe he invites them all?
1.0 The powerful cronic farmers lobby of Seattle called in some favors. YOu get lousy streetview coverage, but really good weed.	1.0 Seconded on the weed, have never had a reason to google streetview Seattle.
1.0 Wouldn't matter: the resultant world war caused by people who felt they were cheated or robbed would end the human race. EOS 1.0 But they would be outnumbered by the masses that would be lifted up, and have the same resources to fight them.	1.0 They'd still have to fight. Once they won the Earth would no longer support life.

1.0 Fight Club . Supposedly the author even thinks this.	1.0 Fight Club the movie was much better mostly due to the ending, in my opinion.
1.0 Starship troopers! Movie ruled, book was unreadable.	1.0 I've heard the opposite many times actually, although I admit I have yet to read the book.
1.0 Starship troopers! Movie ruled, book was unreadable.	1.0 Starship troopers was always one of my favorite books and I thought the movie was stupid and horrible.
1.0 Starship troopers! Movie ruled, book was unreadable.	1.0 I just finished the book and have to say I liked it more than the movie. The movie was good but really didn't have much to do with the book.
1.0 The Godfather. The book was a fairly typical pulp mafia book. The movie was amazing.	1.0 The Godfather, Part II was even better.
1.0 To Kill a Mockingbird EOS 1.0 Are you serious? Classic novel, horrible movie. We'll have to agree to disagree.	1.0 I won't agree to that.
1.0 To Kill a Mockingbird EOS 1.0 Are you serious? Classic novel, horrible movie. We'll have to agree to disagree.	1.0 Yes, for realsies. But I must admit, I have a bit of a man crush on Gregory Peck. Him in the role of Atticus Finch is just stellar.
1.0 Fight Club. EOS 1.0 Indeed. I saw the movie first and was excited about how good the book had to be, but it was a let down. EOS 1.0 Generally you need to read the book first. EOS 1.0 I saw the movie and then read the book. The book is good too, but the movie didn't leave anything the book had out.	1.0 Entire chapter about him and Marla was left out.
1.0 Any of the Harry Potter movies edit: I couldn't actually stand reading any of the books, but I could sit through the movies.	1.0 I have a hard time working out which was worse .
1.0 Two great Orson Welles films, Touch of Evil and The Lady from Shanghai , were based on crappy pulp novels.	1.0 My largest complaint about Touch of Evil is that Charlton Heston played a Mexican and fairly poorly.

1.0 Starship troopers! Movie ruled, book was unreadable. EOS 1.0 That movie is only enjoyable, imo, as an attack on the book. If you haven't read the book, then what point is watching the satire? EOS 1.0 Because it's a satire of fascism, militarism and especially Nazism. That's evident without reading the book. And it has great monsters, and a fun style. Awful ending, but nothing's perfect.	1.0 And Doogie's in it.
1.0 Red Dragon. The movie was passable, but the book was terrible. the Blade Runner Do Androids Dream... comparison is unfair because the book and movie had completely different themes.	1.0 Strongly disagree, but I'll throw in Silence of the Lambs as a replacement as a better movie than the book. Red Dragon was a much better book than the movie.
1.0 That book was also written after the movie was produced. The book wasn't the source material.	1.0 Actually, the book and the screenplay were written simultaneously.

1.0 no, it's the same as if each car hit a wall at 30. EOS 1.0 Or a car traveling at 60 miles an hour hitting a still car in neutral?	1.0 Yes, if you closed your eyes you couldn't tell a difference.
1.0 Which also assumes the wall is completely absolutely immobile, no crumbling, no bouncing rebound or anything.	1.0 And you're not driving a Volvo...
1.0 thank god i don't send my kids to public schools EOS 1.0 Yes, because then they might be able to outsmart you.	1.0 up voted, even at my own expense
1.0 No... vectors are additive it's the same as sixty miles an hour.	1.0 yes vectors certainly are additive, but they're going different directions bud! One's negative :D
1.0 Yeah, by now I've completely forgotten what we're comparing to what. I guess I was thinking of the still car being compared to the brick wall.	1.0 this thread is terrible physics, im going to cry
1.0 completely depends on how heavy the cars are and if they're made of bricks... EOS 1.0 they're identical	1.0 are they made of bricks? ...on a treadmill?
1.0 The act as a cushion during the crash. having twice as much cushion will definately change the result of the crash.	1.0 Yes, one car could have twice the amount of cushion, but that would mean the other has none. 1 1 2 not 1 1 4 or 2 cushion zones per car.

1.0 I really enjoyed Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. Also, No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood.	1.0 I thought it was really good too. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the man!
1.0 The King of Scotland	1.0 NEEK O LOSS
1.0 The Bank Job, though I realize that was a while ago.	1.0 Dude, there's people posting 'The Mighty Ducks' on here.

1.0 Wall E. Also, it had the best ending credits of any movie, ever, so if you go see it do stay till the very end.	1.0 Seconded. Came here to say WALL E, but I'll back you up on the credits. The whole film, right to the end, was absolutely beautiful.
1.0 Wall E. Also, it had the best ending credits of any movie, ever, so if you go see it do stay till the very end.	1.0 Seconded, Thirded, and Fourthed
1.0 Alpha Dog. Somewhere over the course of the film, I went from hating all of the douchebag characters, to sympathizing with them.	1.0 No thanks. The overstated and misused street lingo made it very obvious that the the actors and writers were a bunch of former mickey mouse club members.
1.0 Alpha Dog. Somewhere over the course of the film, I went from hating all of the douchebag characters, to sympathizing with them. EOS 1.0 Alpha Dog really surprised me. I thought for sure I would hate it but it turned out rather well. Even Justin Timberlake's acting was decent.	1.0 I thought his acting was really good. Great movie
1.0 No Country for Old Men. I'm afraid I haven't been able to sit down a watch a movie in a while. EOS 1.0 I would say No Country, There Will be Blood but then I remember Children of Men and it blows those 2 in the dust.	1.0 Children of Men rocks.
1.0 i just watched speed racer. i still feel like i'm on acid.	1.0 Shit, if they'd marketed it like that I might have seen it.
1.0 i just watched speed racer. i still feel like i'm on acid.	1.0 I don't understand why it got such terrible reviews, it seemed like a good film to me. Maybe because I love the anime.
1.0 A few: Run Lola Run, Boondock Saints, Iron Man, Wall E	1.0 I liked Run Lola Run, but its certainly not for everyone.
1.0 A few: Run Lola Run, Boondock Saints, Iron Man, Wall E	1.0 Re: Run Lola Run, if you've seen it once you've seen it 3000 times.
1.0 A few: Run Lola Run, Boondock Saints, Iron Man, Wall E	1.0 Boondock Saints! One of my fave shoot em up scenes ever. I wish all the rumors swirling about the damn sequel were true...
1.0 Akira Kurosawa's classic The Hidden Fortress EOS 1.0 Just saw Rashomon, excellent.	1.0 Me too. I still don't know which version, if any, of the story was most right. That priest needed a good slap, too.
1.0 Seconded. Cloverfield was complete shit.	1.0 Come on, let's be fair here, it wasn't complete shit, I thought the ending credits were quite acceptable.
1.0 Futurama Beast With a Billion Backs, it was hilarious, but maybe that was because I was high... EOS 1.0 i didnt find it that funny actually. i thought it was a great sci fi movie, but it was never laugh out loud funny except for a few parts.	1.0 well, then, you weren't high
1.0 I really enjoyed shoot 'em up. But I like gory senseless ridiculous violence.	1.0 Carrot in the face! Projectile birth!
1.0 Wall E. Also, it had the best ending credits of any movie, ever, so if you go see it do stay till the very end. EOS 1.0 What was at the end again? I actually stayed all the way just in case of something like that but I forgot what it was.	1.0 it flashes the buy n large logo there was a strong here we go again subtext, but maybe that was just me
1.0 In Bruges	1.0 Midget, sorry, dwarf.
1.0 In Bruges	1.0 I agree.
1.0 In Bruges	1.0 Ralph Fiennes' Geico gecko style British accent was a hoot.
1.0 Only if you liked them. EOS 1.0 I did. I just thought the ending in No Country for Old Men was weak. EOS 1.0 Weak is an understatement. I hate dream sequences in movies, and I hate hearing people tell me about their dreams.	1.0 Sounds like we've got a love connection here. We'll be back in 2 and 2.
1.0 Did anyone else enjoy Lost in Translation , I actually went multiple times to watch it.	1.0 You haven't seen a better movie in the last 5 years? I mean, it's pretty good, but...
1.0 Troll 2	1.0 Troll 2 is the best worst movie ever.
1.0 The King of Scotland EOS 1.0 I think you mean The Last King of Scotland EOS 1.0 I think you mean The Last Lazy Eye of Scotland EOS 1.0 I think you mean The Last Least Lazy Eye of Scotland	1.0 I think you mean The Last Least Lazy Eye of Scotland Plus Unnessecary Sex Scenes to Try to Appeal to More Mainstream Viewers
1.0 Only if you liked them. EOS 1.0 I did. I just thought the ending in No Country for Old Men was weak. EOS 1.0 Oooohh, romance is in the air	1.0 Aww shucks...
1.0 Leprechaun in the Hood best movie ever until Leprechan: Back to tha Hood	1.0 Tales from the Hood is another great one in this vein.
1.0 In Bruges EOS 1.0 Except for Colin Farrell. I can't understand how he has a career.	1.0 I'm not a fan of him either, but I thought he was brilliant in this.
1.0 No Country for Old Men. I'm afraid I haven't been able to sit down a watch a movie in a while. EOS 1.0 I would say No Country, There Will be Blood but then I remember Children of Men and it blows those 2 in the dust. EOS 1.0 Couldn't disagree more. I was almost thinking Children of Men was a good movie until I saw There Will be Blood a week later.	1.0 Considering you just agreed that you thought they were both good movies, I disagree that you disagree.
1.0 No. My grandpa died that way. EOS 1.0 There's a big difference between being murdered with a carrot and accidentally dying from sepsis caused by a colon puncture while using several carrots for erotic anal stimulation.	1.0 I hate you for enabling him.
1.0 No Country for Old Men. I'm afraid I haven't been able to sit down a watch a movie in a while. EOS 1.0 There Will Be Blood blows it out of the water.	1.0 Both were great films I found, each had great acting. I found that No Country for Old Men evoked a powerful tone.
1.0 The carrot is there to clue the viewer in to the fact that the movie is a live action Bugs Bunny cartoon. Giamatti is Elmer.	1.0 Clive Owens is Bugs. Monica Belluci is Bugs when he's in his split drag personality a la Fight Club.
1.0 Sometimes I do math in my head.	1.0 Heh, yeah. Crew practice was all about that.
1.0 Fuck, fuck, fuck I hate running so much. Why the hell am I doing this?	1.0 hahah you beat me to it.
1.0 lol, made me laugh	1.0 Here is an excellent example as to what everyone is talking about.

1.0 Then please explain vote up if posts making it to the front page so frequently?	1.0 Who ever said that the rational people are in the majority?
1.0 Then please explain vote up if posts making it to the front page so frequently?	1.0 I'm guessing it's because they get a lot of comments?
1.0 How about Reddit Reservoir to continue your alliteration?	1.0 Nah, the most famous reservoir battle, the Frozen Chosin, consisted of an admittedly heroic withdrawal. Reddit Redoubt has my vote.
1.0 Reddit does not have a spellchecker. Your browser does. Right click on the misspelled word and choose 'Add to dictionary.'	1.0 That finally explains why all these sites have so similar spell checkers.
1.0 I don't get it, you just described reddit. EOS 1.0 top down vs. bottom up	1.0 subdividing the current community vs. branching out into new communities
1.0 The first rule of hacker news is that you don't talk about hacker news.	1.0 What's wrong with news.yc?
1.0 Like the b tards made babies with college humor	1.0 it's more like gamefaqs than anything.
1.0 I like the book much better.	1.0 Yeah, but Bale's delivery is great the perfect mix of horror, hilarity and just great energy. Hey Paul!

1.0 Terry Schiavo EDIT: It's DEAD! No, it's not! Keep watering it!	1.0 So wrong.
1.0 Roses. I give one to every woman that comes to my office.	1.0 Shit does that work as well as giving 500 roses to the women I meet on craigslist?
1.0 Bonsai trees?	1.0 Most bonsai are outdoor plants.
1.0 no its because your moving, the sun cant get you if you keep moving	1.0 upmod because that's just funny.
1.0 The volume control is indicating the amount of attenuation from full power. Why it is indicated this way, instead of a scale of 0 100, say, I don't know.	1.0 Even the really good ones only go to 11 so they have to start with a low enough number to give you enough room to twist the know.
1.0 One of my friends wore a camping backpack to an anything but clothes party. Unzip the bottom, step through, cinch the top under your armpits, and go!	1.0 This. Also, people can put you on as a backpack.
1.0 Lost interest because of the last two words in the title.	1.0 Whereas I thought that was the answer. He was going to wear a guy.
1.0 Tape a 100 bill around your cock. You can play with your money and watch it grow. Last but not least nobody blows 100 bucks like a sorority chick. EOS 1.0 That's, seriously, hilarious. But, it also demonstrates why you've never been invited to a party other than your own. EOS 1.0 Why? Why does that demonstrate that? Its brilliant. EOS 1.0 Relax, that Drunken Asshole won't remember what he wrote come tomorrow morning.	1.0 I wish I didn't remember what I wrote... damn you reddit account!
1.0 Soda tab chain mail and red silk panties.	1.0 panties are clothes...boooo
1.0 a condom?	1.0 a condom .. Don't doubt your suggestion. Fear is the mind killer. I was going to post the same thing. Surely you can get laid at an 'anything but clothes' party.
1.0 Tin foil. EOS 1.0 Do you have any idea of how hot that will be? Almost no heat will escape the body so he will sweat like a pig.	1.0 I don't know if you realize how little tinfoil I'm suggesting. Perhaps a codpiece and some bracers. Maybe a hat if you want to go crazy.

1.0 It's not as bad as you'd think duct tape is non permeable. When you sweat, it kinda pools in there, and that makes the adhesive substantially less effective.	1.0 And how do you know that?
1.0 It's not as bad as you'd think duct tape is non permeable. When you sweat, it kinda pools in there, and that makes the adhesive substantially less effective. EOS 1.0 That seems a bit disgusting. When you take it off, does the sweat pour out? EOS 1.0 Well, it's not a perfect seal and it depends on how much you sweat. When you're on stage in duct tape underwear, yeah, it gets a bit messy.	1.0 upmodded for wearing duct tape, on the crotch, on stage.

1.0 thanks, in a way, i owe it all to you. Your post about a satisfying job inspired me to find better. EOS 1.0 Keep us posted on on the search! EOS 1.0 so far, I woke up at 2 in the afternoon and got on reddit. I'll keep you updated.	1.0 Sounds good so far.
1.0 I beleive it was orignally so people would spend a third of their day working, a third doing their own stuff, and a third sleeping. EOS 1.0 Yes, but that's still arbitrary. Why not quarters? :P EOS 1.0 Well then what the fourth quarter be for?	1.0 I'm sure I can figure out something to do with it.
1.0 Maybe, but this person devoid of all social construct wouldn't be able to share this absolute truth as words or communication concepts would be alien to it.	1.0 If this is the case, the real question is... is truth varelse or ramen?
1.0 Gay, a Gay musical. That sounds pretty gay.	1.0 I'll just put this over here with the rest of the fire...
1.0 The decrease in safety is not worth the decrease in fuel usage. EOS 1.0 What does being in neutral have to do with safety? Yeah you can't instantly speed up, but your brakes and steering still work... EOS 1.0 When in neutral, you cannot accelerate to escape a bad situation. Edited for clarity.	1.0 You must have forgotten the part where you're coasting, and therefore on a downhill slope: ready access to acceleration is not a problem in this situation. It's natural.
1.0 You use less gas in reverse.	1.0 or you can put smaller tires in the front, that way you're always rolling down hill.
1.0 Start saving up the pennies in gas you save to pay for the misc. engine work later on down the road edited...jerks	1.0 When you're slapped you'll take it and like it.
1.0 Bad. when you turn the car back on you use like 3 miles of gasoline	1.0 In old carburetor equipped cars, perhaps, but not anymore. It takes almost no extra fuel to start an already warm injected engine.
1.0 holy shit I thought that neutral was always the way to go.	1.0 It still is for the cars I buy apparently.
1.0 i've heard this too from somewhere else, so maybe there is some truth to it.	1.0 Or maybe it's one of those bullshit things people say over and over until they believe it. Like Republicans are better for national security.
1.0 You use less gas in reverse. EOS 1.0 Your gas increases when you're going in reverse.	1.0 Ow, my brain.
1.0 Does stopping and starting the engine all the time exact some price in the form of wear and tear?	1.0 To the starter motor yes, the engine itself not so much.
1.0 It also is illegal in some areas to coast out of gear. I know for a fact it is in Alabama. EOS 1.0 That's a retarded law. How do they know you're coasting out of gear unless they're in the car with you?	1.0 Some people will admit to anything.
1.0 It's neutered, and the better punchline uses the word 'crankshaft', but thanks for playing.	1.0 You're the guy in that pain Olympics thing aren't you. I'll take your word for it.
1.0 Ohh what year? I drive a 81 Corona down a giant hill everyday. It obviously is using a carburetor not EFI.	1.0 if he's using a ScanGauge II, all the cars he mentioned are 1996 and newer.
1.0 I drive a manual car, so coasting requires I have the clutch down, so there no difference, surely? edit: why the down votes? EOS 1.0 I don't understand your post, but you can just pop it out of gear. Why do you have to have the clutch down? EOS 1.0 Popping it out of gear would make it be in neutral, the same as having the clutch down. I think that is what he means. EOS 1.0 But it's not the same. When you put the transmission in neutral, you can let out the clutch. That's the whole point of neutral.	1.0 No, the whole point of neutral is that you can start the engine without the car moving. But I see what you're saying.
1.0 Ok, so I'm just a 'tard. How then can you know? EOS 1.0 Its a fact that modern engines shut off the gas when you are coasting in gear. If you want to see proof, buy a Scanguage or something similar. EOS 1.0 I believe you, just didn't know. EOS 1.0 I just meant that one of those gauges would be how one could know for sure if a specific vehicle was doing that.	1.0 Cool. I'll have to check that out, it'd be helpful to be able to tell.
1.0 You use less gas in reverse. EOS 1.0 Plus you take miles off your car's odometer. EOS 1.0 How's that going, Bueller?	1.0 I think the problem was for Fry.
1.0 The car being towed is being towed, not coasting.	1.0 Fair enough, just curious.
1.0 Mama always said, Life is like a box of chocolates. She also said, If you are bored, that means you are boring. Mama drank quite a bit, though.	1.0 He has some point. The last time I was eager to hop on the Internet was around the General Election time when all the debates were going on.
1.0 I'd go back in time and bring child me into the future and raise him as my child, instilling all the knowledge I currently have into him, and therefore me.	1.0 Ow. I think my brain popped.
1.0 Bill Hicks	1.0 you mean Andre Hicks
1.0 Jesus, so he can tell everybody they're doing it wrong.	1.0 But don't bring him back, that way he won't be crucified and the problem with Christianity will be solved.
1.0 A Pregnant T Rex. Because I'm a prick like that. EOS 1.0 Pretty sure they are oviparous.	1.0 Hmm. My plan involved fertilized eggs, more than anything, that way there'd probably be a breeding pair available to me. Ideas, ideas...
1.0 Albert Einstein. EOS 1.0 Cliche post is cliche.	1.0 I didn't know answering who i'd bring back would be considered cliche. And can we stop with that x y is x format?
1.0 I'd go back in time and bring child me into the future and raise him as my child, instilling all the knowledge I currently have into him, and therefore me. EOS 1.0 Good idea, I'm gonna try that right now... OH SHI	1.0 Honestly, the very idea of time travel is bogus. I very much doubt it will ever be possible. I realize my scenario would probably collapse the pocket universe.
1.0 I have done a lot of crazy things in my youth, upvoting a story because i commented on it is just the tip of the iceberg.	1.0 I only upvoted for this comment.
1.0 I have done a lot of crazy things in my youth, upvoting a story because i commented on it is just the tip of the iceberg.	1.0 Wow, did I just witness the birth of a new Reddit meme?

1.0 I bet I could jump 100 sharks. EOS 1.0 Big deal. Evil Knievel could jump 100 sharks and through 2 rings of fire. EOS 1.0 see what happens when you're late.	1.0 Come to think of it, that IS why he made the jump. Why would any sane person do it otherwise?
1.0 Who the hell is so out of it that they still read Dave Barry?	1.0 I assumed he had already died a quiet death, far from the awareness of the public, a few years ago. You learn something new every day.
1.0 How would one go about finding local auctions?	1.0 The classified section of the newspaper often has a listing.
1.0 An argument like that is bound to go nowhere, kind of like arguing about religion, abortion or Packers vs. Vikings. Just agree to disagree and go out for a beer.	1.0 Well, everyone knows the Vikings suck.
1.0 Why should YOU have the burden of proof? What evidence does HE have for HIS theory, besides a multiply translated and edited bronze age book of questionable provenance?	1.0 This is a defensive position. Why shouldn't he go on the offense?
1.0 There are several excellent video series on YouTube. Search for the following users: cdk007 potholer54 aronra donexodus2 thunderf00t	1.0 I have seen nearly all of thunderf00t's videos and his trashing of the venom guy. simply awesome.

1.0 I have a hard time finding a reason to go out for a beer with a vikings fan. But seriously, the vikings blow.	1.0 Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy. Benjamin Franklin.
1.0 Don't bother. No amount of scientific proof will convince them, they've already rejected science. It's like trying to teach someone how to read by writing the instructions down.	1.0 I agree. A closed mind hears nothing but itself.
1.0 Don't get into an argument with a creationist. It's a wasteof your time.	1.0 Don't get into an argument. It's a waste of your time.

1.0 s government has private interests lobbying the government have g	1.0 protip: With Sed, you don't need the g for a single replacement. g is global, i.e. all matches.
1.0 In B.C. a non life threatening ambulance ride costs 40. Must be that privatized health care thing Klien was going on aboiut.	1.0 In NB ambulance rides are now free. It just came into affect a couple years ago and I think it's a great idea.

1.0 A large bonfire, then grind the bones up in a woodchipper. Then just spread it around like fertilizer... my petunias never looked so vibrant with color. EOS 1.0 Bad idea. Aren't burning bodies supposed to have a very strong smell?	1.0 Yeah, like steak. Just use some garlic and pepper.
1.0 A large bonfire, then grind the bones up in a woodchipper. Then just spread it around like fertilizer... my petunias never looked so vibrant with color. EOS 1.0 Bad idea. Aren't burning bodies supposed to have a very strong smell? EOS 1.0 Yes, and a body cannot be completely consumed in a fire. Grinding in a woodchipper would spread any remaining DNA everywhere.

1.0 A very long engagement, Cinema Paradisio, The Valet, The Man From Earth EOS 1.0 Cinema Paradiso, one of the best films ever made.	1.0 Well, Now that I know you have good taste in Movies, what are your picks?
1.0 Primer, Repo Man, Hard Candy. All three are fuckin' amazing. EOS 1.0 Hard Candy sucked, and Ellen Page is not a good actress.	1.0 I thought she did a decent job. Perhaps not exceptional, but certainly good. And the visuals in the film, cinematography and coloring is really, really impressive.
1.0 K PAX Dark City EOS 1.0 A very strange combo to suggest... EOS 1.0 Why? They're both sci fi and not exactly mainstream. I enjoyed both of them and it's rare I meet anyone who's seen them both.	1.0 It's just like saying Requiem For A Dream or In The Bedroom are both Dramas... So they would pair well with Fried Green Tomatoes...

1.0 I noticed you said you were in CA, where abouts? If you are in San Diego, I would also recommend 'Red Trolley' from the Karl Strauss brewery.	1.0 nah, my bro is in california. i'm in PA
1.0 my past, and the stories of other male rape victims whose stories will be ignored.	1.0 This comment just made me cry.
1.0 The Lion King edit: and The Green Mile	1.0 The end of Terminator 2.
1.0 The Lion King edit: and The Green Mile	1.0 For me, that scene in dumbo where is mom is locked up and that Baby mine don't you cry song comes on.
1.0 I'm a girl, so I cry about everything.	1.0 Me, too. Right now those Morgan Freeman Olympic commercials have me welling up each time they come on.
1.0 Crying is healthy you need the release.	1.0 Lungs hurting is not healthy. Chthonius, you might wanna check on that.
1.0 Crying is healthy you need the release.	1.0 Depression has a stubborn way of overriding natural cycles.
1.0 Shawshank Redemption. In fact I get misty eyed about any movie that has destiny, or man finding his destiny as a main plot point. EOS 1.0 The Green Mile, when they execute John Coffey.	1.0 every fucking time
1.0 and we're scared of the NSA...why? EOS 1.0 To be fair, I would presume that the NSA's researchers and technicians are at least slightly more technologically sophisticated than the average Air Force officer.	1.0 I would hope so, and my comment was clearly a potshot.
1.0 What if I smelled you?	1.0 can i watch?
1.0 What if I smelled you?	1.0 I might cry, depending on certain things. No, I'm wrong. I'd cry nonetheless. Actually, I'm crying right now.
1.0 whenever i sit down to fix a computer and i see a Norton product installed. EOS 1.0 Whenever my mother starts complaining that her wireless keyboard isn't working, because it's batteries are dead.	1.0 My mom complains that the internet is broken when it takes three seconds for the airport to scan and connect to our wireless router.
1.0 Um... bicycles? EOS 1.0 and ladders.	1.0 aaaaaaa Don't scare me like that.
1.0 I'm a girl, so I cry about everything. EOS 1.0 Did you ever cry about crying? EOS 1.0 Ahh.. meta crying. EOS 1.0 I cry about talking about my problem of self referential crying in comments on reddit about what makes men cry.	1.0 Ahh... Nth order meta crying.
1.0 I'm a girl, so I cry about everything. EOS 1.0 You weren't asked! Read the headline! EOS 1.0 DON'T MAKE ME CRY	1.0 cry! CRY ! Muhahahahahahaha....
1.0 I would get rid of the girl AND the cat. I'm assuming you didn't.	1.0 Nahhhh at least not the cat. I got him neutered later that day, so I guess we're even.
1.0 Mine is: Tequila Sunrise Shot of Tequila, Orange Juice and Grenadine over ice.	1.0 That's what I came to say! I like mine with about a shot, rather than a splash, of grenadine.
1.0 No. It's a waste of money. Buy a T bill or something. EOS 1.0 Methinks you overestimate the long term value of a T bill.	1.0 Well, you don't wanna lock it up in T bonds. That's a long time.
1.0 buy a replacement jack, its goes for like 15 bucks, and replacing it took about 30 min. not too hard.	1.0 I would have if I was still in the states, but I can't find anywhere that sells spare iPod parts in Korea and I'm here for another year.
1.0 In all seriousness, what were you expecting us to tell you? No matter what you do, it just won't make a difference.	1.0 What the hell is wrong with you, douchebag?
1.0 It's a geek comic. Having the humour in the text is fine.	1.0 Yeah, that is fine, but still: this webcomic uses far too much of it. Its jokes aren't concise. There's a bit of rambling going on.
1.0 They have set us up the blog!	1.0 you made a fool out of me. thank you.
1.0 My only advice: Make sure its something everyone understands and can relate to. Your local references for example mean nothing to me, and draw away from the overall experience.	1.0 The early PhD comics had Stanford references.
1.0 My only advice: Make sure its something everyone understands and can relate to. Your local references for example mean nothing to me, and draw away from the overall experience.	1.0 Some of them don't particularly need context even though they are local. The GPS one is a great example.
1.0 Liked it. But you need to add your signature within the strip itself. EOS 1.0 and rollover text. EOS 1.0 and black hats	1.0 and penis
1.0 I just saw the A one and laughed, I'm definitely checking this comic out. EOS 1.0 I didn't get that one. I assume the alien is fixing NASA's code, and I suspect that an A search is a less desirable algorithm. EOS 1.0 A is a path finding algorithm. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's considered one of the better ones.	1.0 Hee! I get it now. : P
1.0 I, too, plan on living off the rich dividends of selling the fruit of my random musings. When will reddit have a PayPal option??	1.0 I just sent you 100. In lolcats.
1.0 Yeah, I have specially made ice cubes just to make the most pleasing clinking sounds. You should come to my place one day and witness this. EOS 1.0 It's a trap! Where are you guys? Who's rich and wants to pay for my ticket...? EOS 1.0 I have too much disposable income. I'm in Chicago, are you hot? EOS 1.0 I'm here for the gangbang. EOS 1.0 But are you hot?	1.0 That depends on what your definition of 'is' is.
1.0 Actually I'd prefer that the most highly rated comments automatically filter up to the top. This seems to happen in a haphazard way at this time. EOS 1.0 Great idea... would the threads or replies follow too?	1.0 EDIT...it already works that way...I just never noticed the little dropdown thing above the comment box.
1.0 I'm not your friend, buddy! EOS 1.0 I'm not your buddy, guy! EOS 1.0 I'm not your guy, bro!	1.0 Bro? I'm sorry, you must be mistaken. I am not your brother, tdehnel.
1.0 They should also let you collapse an entire thread and let you downmod everyone who participated. It might help get rid of the bullshit 4chan pun garbage.	1.0 Not likely! Adding that feature would cost a 4chan.
1.0 Okay, I could see that, but only if the chance is given to stick only the first comment made by the op. Otherwise I could see the potential for abuse EOS 1.0 Hmm.. Maybe articles could have both a title and a summary... like Digg or Slashdot. Oh, wait.	1.0 Well, I could see how it could help with self posts. Maybe not all of them.
1.0 I'm not your friend, buddy! EOS 1.0 Im not your buddy, guy! EOS 1.0 I'm not your guy, pal! EOS 1.0 I'm not your pal, douchebag!	1.0 Can't we all just get along?!
1.0 How much are you willing to spend? What OS are you familiar with and would you be willing to learn a new one?	1.0 I'm familiar with Windows, but I'm perfectly willing to learn a new one.
1.0 What will you be using your laptop for? EOS 1.0 Student type activities. EOS 1.0 Porn? Looking up drink recipes? Facebook?	1.0 In addition to redditing, procrastinating, listening to music, downloading tv shows, and maybe occaisionally gaming.
1.0 Be more specific what is it that you expect from the site?	1.0 I don't know about him but I want everyone to join my subreddits so I can run reddit the way I see fit.
1.0 Because nothing I've ever experienced has convinced me to believe.	1.0 plus it multiplies beyond necessity
1.0 There's not a scrap of evidence to suggest it's true. Religious hypotheses fail where scientific hypotheses succeed.	1.0 Thank God we live in times where science is so awesome.
1.0 Saw one as a kid. As I've aged I even question my own memories. In the end we all die. Just try to enjoy the ride.	1.0 That's all you can do.
1.0 Greek Gods were awesome. Now the Roman Gods, what a bunch of pussies.	1.0 not to mention the glory of norse gods.
1.0 Because the big secret is that we all live our lives over and over again. EOS 1.0 So how do you explain expansion? Spontaneous generation?	1.0 Of course, it's in another world, dude.
1.0 Ignorance is bliss	1.0 And xtians are the happiest people on earth.
1.0 That's really deep. EOS 1.0 That's what SHE said!!!	1.0 Then you woke up.
1.0 Gay people exist. I live near West Hollywood. I know.	1.0 oooh topical!
1.0 Amy Winehouse EOS 1.0 oooh topical!	1.0 Hawaii tropical
1.0 Then I'll raise you a Flying Spaghetti Monster.	1.0 first law of spaghettinamics: the flying of a monster in a closed system can never be raised or lowered.
1.0 all the popular kids are rejecting god! EOS 1.0 and people are gay because of the media too!	1.0 why else would a man love another man? could it be that anything, even a hand, can make a man feel good in that way?
1.0 Santa Claus is a form of wishful thinking. Kids think Santa Claus must exist because it would be so wonderful if he existed.	1.0 Yeah, i know i want strange fat man crawling down my chimney and leaving presents under my bush .
1.0 silence Are you from the future?	1.0 Even more terrifying.... I am from the now .
1.0 Simple. Occam's Razor.	1.0 and you know occam wasn't shaving with no quad blade, self lubricating, vibrating shit...
1.0 Oh ha ha ha. How witty.	1.0 no yuo
1.0 Straight up now tell me are you Really gonna love me forever!!! I can't believe I fucked that up... EOS 1.0 You need to get over Paula Abdul, get off of Reddit.. and get out more.	1.0 That is an option... I'll see what I can do...
1.0 Straight up now tell me are you Really gonna love me forever!!! I can't believe I fucked that up... EOS 1.0 You need to get over Paula Abdul, get off of Reddit.. and get out more.	1.0 oh oh oh, he's been telling lies!
1.0 What? Your girlfriend will allow you to hook up with a wild mountain cat when you go to Atlantic City? EOS 1.0 I was wondering how he could be in Air Conditioning. Yours makes much more sense.	1.0 I was wondering if there were cougar characters in the new Animal Crossing.
1.0 What? Your girlfriend will allow you to hook up with a wild mountain cat when you go to Atlantic City? EOS 1.0 I was wondering how he could be in Air Conditioning. Yours makes much more sense.	1.0 Atlantic City does make more sense than air ducts, I suppose.
1.0 Well how did the cougar get in the AC in the first place?	1.0 Ventilation shaft, duh.
1.0 Kill yourself. It s your own fault for not having insurance, since you clearly chose a lifestyle that would not make insurance available for you.	1.0 wtf, that's not funny.. at least i hope you were trying to be funny.
1.0 Sounds like you may have Tinnitus, for which there is no cure so save your money.	1.0 Thanks WebMD
1.0 He doesn't mention it because he'll use it to win. EOS 1.0 You forget he's not a Republican.	1.0 He is still a politician. I think America is too badly wounded to trust another politician without debate and contemplation. Never trust a politician, a priest and a plumber.
1.0 The Vatican. They are the only country that is 100 funded by renewable energy: Guilt Power	1.0 The same could be said about Israel.
1.0 Canada for being America, hold the tyranny, with extra bacon.	1.0 and a side of hockey.
1.0 you forgot bicycles, and weed. The Dutch culture rules too. Did you know that vending machines for hot fried snacks can be found in most cities. They are amazing.	1.0 You are the first FEBO fan I have ever come across!
1.0 Norway, Netherlands, luxembourg, finland, denmark and Belgium. Most countries have their obvious problems, but for me it is hard to find any problems with those countries. EOS 1.0 Fixed: ..it is hard to find any of those countries. EOS 1.0 Hey, Finland is right here.	1.0 Hi, Finland! How You Doin'?
1.0 surely you ar ejoking, the US immigration policy is like australias, if you are white and educated it is a lot easier than if you dont fall into those categories.	1.0 It's easier if you speak Spanish and hire an immigration specialist to transport you across the border.
1.0 Iceland.. but I might be partial.	1.0 I'm surprised there aren't more votes for Iceland I've heard a lot of good things about Iceland, especially in ways of environmental sustainability.
1.0 I guess you haven't heard of Telecom then... chuckles	1.0 Is that some kind of corporate controlled, large, fascist ISP? When will some genius coder liberate us all with an alternative to the corporate or government controlled ISPs?
1.0 Canada for being America, hold the tyranny, with extra bacon. EOS 1.0 While I am a fan of bacon, their bacon sux. EOS 1.0 You mean what Americans call Canadian bacon? It is called back bacon in Canada, and bacon is called bacon, if memory serves.	1.0 i still call canadian bacon ham working for a pizzeria and all.
1.0 And you can climb Mt. Doom.	1.0 I'm in the MOOD for DOOM!
1.0 Hong Kong because it's the most economical liberal country in the world. EOS 1.0 Hong Kong is not a country.	1.0 You tell them that.
1.0 Mauritius, Island wide, uncensored, wifi. EOS 1.0 Are the downloads capped? EOS 1.0 Don't think so. EOS 1.0 Do they have strict immigration policies? If not i'm dropping out of school and packing my bags.	1.0 They strongly encourage tourism and new residents.
1.0 America is an absolutely brilliant idea that has been getting steadily, tragically worse in application.	1.0 LOL, when you put it down like that you make it sound like Communism.
1.0 Oh, oh oh	1.0 mumble mumble hit and run.
1.0 A comment point system that rewards high quality comments and prevents users from using it to express agreement or disagreement only.	1.0 Go on, pull the other one!
1.0 A comment point system that rewards high quality comments and prevents users from using it to express agreement or disagreement only.	1.0 I completely disagree with you, but rather than tell you why or make a rational argument, I'm going to downmod you.
1.0 A comment point system that rewards high quality comments and prevents users from using it to express agreement or disagreement only. EOS 1.0 slashdots comment system EOS 1.0 ok so allow me to add a condition to my proposal above: ...and manages to keep the clean looks and simplicity of the Reddit system.	1.0 slashdots comment system but not ugly
1.0 Some protesters were violent...	1.0 i guess i relied too much on the reddit point of view...aka.. peaceful monks gettin slaughtered by violent Chinese authorities
1.0 The olympics are pretty much drug infested settings for corporate money grabbing. Regardless of China, I'd still like to pee on it. EOS 1.0 Then you should settle your urges in the privacy of your own home, not on reddit.	1.0 I'd like to take a giant piss on leprecon...
1.0 Are You Being Served?	1.0 Meh... 'Allo 'Allo was better. Still good, though.
1.0 Red Dwarf	1.0 Love it! I was actually introduced to it last month when I was in South Africa.
1.0 Discussion thread Let's post all discussion comments as replies to this thread so we can discuss but it doesn't affect voting. EOS 1.0 Looks like 'Oz' doesnt sit too well with folks here. I thought 5 of the 6 seasons that aired on HBO were stellar.	1.0 I love Oz ... the acting is great by such a vast cast. Adabesi, Karim Saeed, Schillinger, Oriely .. my god, amazing characters.
1.0 The Office EOS 1.0 the original, or the boring brit one?	1.0 Don't worry, I got it.
1.0 The Office EOS 1.0 wait.. UK or NBC version?	1.0 NBC is what most of the votes are for. That being said, the UK original is brilliant.
1.0 Doctor Who EOS 1.0 And Torchwood	1.0 Dude... Who's downmodding Torchwood?
1.0 While I can appreciate Arrested Development is great comedy, to say it's better than Monty Python or Office UK makes you look stupid. Because it's not.	1.0 MIndless Anglophile.
1.0 Arrested Development: The Movie. Enough said.	1.0 What he said.
1.0 While I can appreciate Arrested Development is great comedy, to say it's better than Monty Python or Office UK makes you look stupid. Because it's not. EOS 1.0 No, it is.	1.0 I don't know about Monty Python, but that's only because I have a thing for really really stupid humor.
1.0 Total Recall 2070	1.0 This show was awesome. I'm sad it only lasted one season.
1.0 vampires cool, space cool. space vampires fucking awesome!	1.0 The Filthy Critic has an awesome commentary on robot vampires somewhere in the internets. Bloody funny and worth finding.
1.0 vampires cool, space cool. space vampires fucking awesome!	1.0 have you seen dracula 3000? vampires in space are lame
1.0 The Chinese invented paper That edges out AD, but not by much	1.0 The French invented film!
1.0 My name is Judge. Nuff said.	1.0 Nicely played.
1.0 Arrested Development: The Movie. Enough said. EOS 1.0 Making a movie of something you liked a lot in the original is almost always a bad idea.	1.0 It's a better idea than never making anything ever.
1.0 Star Trek EOS 1.0 Okay. Let's make this more specific...	1.0 Star Trek Enterprise
1.0 The Graduate	1.0 Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.
1.0 Dances With Wolves EOS 1.0 i upmodded you, then realized you posted twice! how could two movies be the best ever, bigshot? EOS 1.0 you actually posted several times, you clown	1.0 I thought the point was to put up nominees, then let everyone vote. I have several favorites, why limit myself?
1.0 There's way too much downmodding going on in this thread. People should just vote for the show they think is the best.	1.0 I guess people are just trying to help their fav shows by also downmodding other shows.
1.0 30 Rock	1.0 well it is pretty good but, best ever would be too much.
1.0 As far as I know, there isn't a single one that exists. Of course, I'm probably wrong... I guess I could check google... Hmmm... Maybe I'll just ask reddit instead. EOS 1.0 Why would you waste the time to reply to this if you were going to complain about how I'm supposedly wasting your time?	1.0 To be ironic, I guess...
1.0 Where did you read I was spreading this myth exactly?	1.0 Oops you're right. I guess I shouldn't post high.
1.0 Wait... what?	1.0 I was with a couple friends, really baked, and one of them looks around and says What if we...uh...what?
1.0 See rest of thread please before kneejerking. We're having a valid discussion.	1.0 Using weak peer pressure tactics to convince someone on the fence to jump to your side just so you can feel better does not equate to a valid discussion.
1.0 I think alcohol and cigarettes are just as much gateway drugs. With that said, gateway drug is really a bullshit phrase that actually means nothing. also, i agree with you	1.0 The biggest gateway drug is the drug itself. Once you try, even once, a certain drug your likelihood of using it again goes up like crazy.
1.0 Getting caught? Thank jesus I live in BC where you can smoke next to a cop and he won't say a thing.	1.0 don't give our secret away!
1.0 I wish I could grow some again. I like the smell and look of the leaves. EOS 1.0 I know, is it crazy that I would want pot scented candles? Or something that smells tastes like different strains of pot to season with while cooking?	1.0 I've always thought a bud based pesto would be really nice.
1.0 I wish I could grow some again. I like the smell and look of the leaves. EOS 1.0 I know, is it crazy that I would want pot scented candles? Or something that smells tastes like different strains of pot to season with while cooking? EOS 1.0 How about some hash incense? I don't know about the taste. My regular oatmeal cookies tasted better than my pot oatmeal cookies.	1.0 I always thought hash was pretty yummy. Also, opium tasty! But then, so are poppy seed muffins, so that makes sense.
1.0 Every time I ask my dog about smoking pot, he says it's ruff.	1.0 Wow. Still, upmodded.
1.0 I would not if you have a addictive personality. Otherwise go ahead.	1.0 Is an addictive personality when you're so charismatic that people just can't get enough of you? If yes then no, I don't have it.
1.0 You ever suck dick for a hershey bar? EOS 1.0 it was for a toblerone, damnit	1.0 Oh, then thats understandable.
1.0 You ever suck dick for a hershey bar? EOS 1.0 it was for a toblerone, damnit	1.0 What would you do for a Klondike bar?
1.0 Cocaine isn't nearly as bad either. Neither is heroin. I'm sick of all you anti drug people. Drugs aren't bad. I wouldn't care if my kids used them.	1.0 Coke is real addictive, makes you want lots, lots more. So even if its not going to kill you its probably not genna do your wallet any good.
1.0 That said, most people don't really feel it the first time unless you smoke eat an obscene amount. About 2 3 times in will you finally start to feel it.	1.0 What!? what!? what!? My first time I had one hoot and I was fucked.
1.0 the guy i was replying to deleted his comment, ass	1.0 He loses one intarnet for that one!
1.0 Be prepared to try it twice. My first time nothing happened, and I hear that's pretty common. I was really disappointed.	1.0 And relatively soon after the first time. Smoking once, and then waiting a month week before trying it again usually has the same effects as smoking for the first time.
1.0 Good to know. I haven't actually tried cooking with pot my knowledge is purely theoretical.	1.0 Melt some butter, drop in your weed, strain, and use as directed.
1.0 I've never done anything other than weed. I haven't tried cigarettes.	1.0 I started smoking buds before I tried tobacco and even then I only had one or two cigarettes and never had another.
1.0 i think it happens because first time smokers don't know how to inhale properly. EOS 1.0 Often its because people don't inhale properly, but it also takes a while to get used to the effects and identify what is caused by the mj.	1.0 fo sho, i wonder if its chemical though, have you ever met anyone that said, ya i got high as balls the first time?
1.0 If you can take Salvia, you'd be fine on Acid and Shrooms too. Salvia is much harder even though it lasts only a fraction of the time.	1.0 Interesting thought. I didn't actually hallucinate when I smoked salvia, though. My perspective was just very different.
1.0 C'mon, now. I've got a weed hangover as I type this. EOS 1.0 give up the schwiggidy, and problem solved.	1.0 I'm aware.
1.0 Good idea! EOS 1.0 You have to say something to get people to reply to your comment first. Otherwise you don't get any upmods. EOS 1.0 Indeed. that's how pyramid schemes work, those who get in early, benefit from everyone below them...if you get in late and don't have anyone below you, then you lose. EOS 1.0 I'm feeling generous today EOS 1.0 i hope i wont be at the bottom...	1.0 Join now for great success!
1.0 Dishonesty Be honest with them. They are trying assess how trustworthy you are. If they find stuff that you haven't mentioned then it makes you like deceitful.	1.0 Being a Democrat. They will check your registration.
1.0 Having relatives in Eastern Europe. I once applied for a job at Pratt, and was denied because my mom had cousins she had never met living in Poland.	1.0 Fuck, all my relatives are Finnish. Including me...
1.0 Look for a better job	1.0 Nah, it's just today. Otherwise, I love my job.
1.0 hmmm. thanks for scaring me. EOS 1.0 You don't need a therapist. If you want to pay someone lots of money to give you insight, pay me. 200 per hour.	1.0 I'll do it for 175!!!
1.0 Just a suggestion anyway.	1.0 Sorry about that. Maybe it's just a personal aversion, but I tend to recoil when therapy is given as advice. I didn't intend to be so negative.
1.0 stop thinking about yourself. make something good happen EOS 1.0 WOW, thank you. I really love your advice. For some reason it really rings.	1.0 Ok... then the ball is in your court. There are lots of people who want to help. They just don't know what they can do.
1.0 Damn... there is no way I could possibly beat that! EOS 1.0 In that case. 170! EOS 1.0 Wait... How does he feel about talking to someone in india? I can get him setup for 45 an hour!	1.0 Whoh Whoh Whoooh. We talkin outsourcin? Ok, I can get him a Chinese Grad student for 30 an hour that will also teach him advanced number theory.
1.0 I actually did, friend. I looked, gathered some information but what I found was a lot of doublespeak. I'm just looking for someone to tell it to me straight. EOS 1.0 And you think you won't get doublespeak on reddit?? Hmmm...	1.0 You make a good point, I might. But it's better than whatever else I could find. My question has been mostly answered, so thanks everyone.
1.0 I couldn't readily find anything either... Is it really not vermillion? What is this Vermilliad plant, as far as you know of it?	1.0 I thought Vermilion when she said it also, dtallee was right on with bromeliad though, that's what it was.

Turning gay isn't a problem, turning rapist is.	1.0 no.... acting hetero when sober amp then temporarily coming out of the closet when drunk....There IS something wrong with that.
1.0 Avoid ugly chicks at parties. If you are drinking you will probably fuck them, and there will be witnesses and photographic evidence to prove it the next morning.	1.0 Pussy is pussy, and girls who have to compensate for their lack of good looks will do so in many ways.

EOS 1.0 well, it's an extension of the previous vowel sound, is how my japanese teacher and friends told me. Is that wrong? It's not pronounced as U, per se. EOS 1.0 Extending the sound can sometimes make it an entirely different word. So yes.	1.0 right, it can, it's not pronounced as U is what I meant. So to an untrained ear it's difficult to differentiate between with and without it.
1.0 The old machines have magnets to help you put money in when it's dark and smokey.	1.0 Sorry, feeling jerkish.

1.0 This calls for a does she have a sister? moment.	1.0 She does, but sadly they are completely different girls. Her older sister is much more in to fashion and modeling. Not exactly my type. I got the fun one!
1.0 I never had one.	1.0 Thanks for the input.
1.0 You are met at the door by 3 young beautiful women who escort you to the room, and... EOS 1.0 The second one turns out to be a goat, do you now choose to stay with the first young beautiful woman or do you switch to the third one?	1.0 you, sir, cannot be upmodded enough for this one.

Then you have fifty fifty of getting the good prize.
1.0 Really.. and some rich asshole wouldn't view your kidney as a commodity? You think he'd live his life any differently, or treat you any differently?	1.0 So? If he mistreats the kidney, that's his problem.
1.0 The men have to jerk off to a schedule, for a year.	1.0 And you see a problem with this how exactly?
1.0 If being able to use complete sentences is etilism, then call me an etilist. Note: Any possible error in this comment has to be understood as a meta joke. EOS 1.0 I don't believe for a moment etilism was a meta joke! And no, elitism isn't the ability to use complete sentences, it's the notion that people who don't are inferior. EOS 1.0 Aren't they? EOS 1.0 That's debatable...	1.0 For sure.

1.0 I am the one who doles out the punishment around here.	1.0 Either way, record and share, mmkay?
1.0 I am the one who doles out the punishment around here.	1.0 Leave the networking cable in the computer room. It would make a dangerous whip, and a flying RJ45 connector end can take someone's eye out.
1.0 wait, you still don't know what they're for. What if it's for a peer to peer? the order must be 1 3 2 6 instead of direct. EOS 1.0 Is that still true? I thought they did away with crossover cables. I think most modern network cards just do the swap internally.	1.0 I have noticed this is often the case now, which is pretty convenient.
1.0 The gist of mine was to tell men in general to get over it and just buy the damn tampons. EOS 1.0 Yeah! And grab yourself a six pack while you're at it. That's what I tell my husband.	1.0 You are a good person.

1.0 I read Descartes	1.0 Therefore, ...
1.0 you cant, just enjoy the ride. EOS 1.0 This is also how I convince myself that I am not the deterministic sum of chemical and physical reactions around me.	1.0 You are. But doesn't that just make everything you accomplish much more exciting?
1.0 you cant, just enjoy the ride. EOS 1.0 This is also how I convince myself that I am not the deterministic sum of chemical and physical reactions around me. EOS 1.0 Things are more than merely the sum of their parts.	1.0 I guess that is the ultimate question.
1.0 you cant, just enjoy the ride. EOS 1.0 This is also how I convince myself that I am not the deterministic sum of chemical and physical reactions around me.

1.0 You are wrong, WE YOU ME are is everything we experience. There is nothing outside of our experience. Nothing prior.

EOS 1.0 For the love of science, yes dammit.	1.0 Hehe, I was taking a confucious approach to it.
1.0 Eat a bunch of apples, then eat a few eggs, a couple tablespoons of sugar, some yeast, and salt. Not delicious. Apple pie? Delicious. QED.

1.0 I've thought about getting a motorcycle. What is it about them that makes people get injured so often? EOS 1.0 Well. No airbags, no crumple zone, no headrest for a start.	1.0 People see a smaller vehicle and follow waaay too closely or just look around you, not realizing that you need MORE space than a car.

1.0 Your country sounds awesome. How is it doing now?	1.0 Pretty shitty, thanks. And yours?
1.0 Good that you did not switch on anything with electricity. The spark is enough to set off an explosion if enough gas is present. EOS 1.0 Theres a window of gas concentration that you need to hit for an explosion. Methane is 4.4 to 17 EOS 1.0 So if the concentration is greater than 17 , there won't be an explosion...?	1.0 Probably has to do with the ratio of methane to oxygen.
1.0 Why did you faint?	1.0 I don't fucking know.
1.0 Why did you faint?	1.0 He got knocked by the rocks. Like when a boxer punches another in the head and the guy falls down. Or maybe he lost enough blood to loose consciousness temporarily.
1.0 Why did you faint?	1.0 Got the wind knocked out of him, so there was some hypoxia when he stood up, the blood pressure to his head dropped precipitously, and so did he.
1.0 Still, punching yourself to death would be an awesome way to die.	1.0 I'd laugh during the funeral, no doubt.
1.0 I was born. Umb cord wrapped twice 'round the neck. I was blue. Daba dee daba die daba dee daba die..... EOS 1.0 I wonder how rare that is.

1.0 I still can't decide whether I should downvote your post for the first line or upvote it because of the second part. EOS 1.0 That idea is very old.	1.0 As are pretty much all ideas that are worth anything.
1.0 Its quite possible they died in the deep end. If you think two 9 year olds drowning in a pool is not a possibility, I hope you are never responsible for children. EOS 1.0 Sadly, the dumbest and least educated have MORE children.	1.0 Even sadder given that having more children is always a good evolutionary strategy.

1.0 I bet you are scared of taxis now. That story was Fresh. The whole thing sounds surreal. EOS 1.0 Oh I still get into taxis. I just make sure the driver isn't white! EOS 1.0 I guess if the taxi guy in your story was black, it would be the other way round. That's how racism starts.	1.0 Not really but if they're Indian you know they're legit.
1.0 Wow, what year was this? EOS 1.0 You drive a logging truck? EOS 1.0 That was really funny. No, I ride the STP and I wanted to know what year he went so that I can find out the route. EOS 1.0 Late reply. haha, 8 days late. I rode... 1992, 93, and 94. I think that incident happened in 93.	1.0 Thank you, That was a little bit before my time. I don't think I even knew how to ride a bike then.
1.0 Take a look at the comments on almost any thread on Digg and you will see that Reddit is doing just fine. EOS 1.0 Being better than Digg isn't saying much.

1.0 What the hell is Reddit? EOS 1.0 It's a place for political Americans, you wouldn't understand. It also a place for Christian fundamentalist hating and atheist message boards.	1.0 Sounds like a whole buncha homosexin' to me.

1.0 That just doesnt happen. It is advisable to use common sense in certain situations. EOS 1.0 Huh? It did happen. Why are you telling me that something that I know happened doesn't happen ... Where is the sense in your reply?	1.0 Look, a website doesnt just stop working on a particular browser. You might have got malware in your computer, but this is not a universal problem.
1.0 Out of curiosity, what's the area you're going to track?	1.0 Well Textbook Torrents is now just a forum, so I'm going to do it again.

Hiyah! Downmodded! EOS 1.0 Wow I hope not.

1.0 Then it should be called Ask Redditors . EOS 1.0 We aren't redditors. We are reddit.	1.0 That is a misconstruction.
1.0 It's probably a performance thing. They remove features to make reddit faster.	1.0 Yea, but that's retarded. If it's temporary fine, just let us know. But they should invest in upgrading their equipment if they need performance enhancement not removing features.

1.0 and yet when the time comes, he will unhesitatingly choose the succeeding SupJudges based on this one issue	1.0 What evidence do you base this claim upon? Has Paul said anything about what justices he would appoint if elected President?

1.0 Biden is too scared to do what he does. He should be attacking, yet he's playing D.	1.0 He has more to lose.
1.0 They both came off as personable and respectful, but on the issues, Biden won by showing that McCain isn't about change, he's simply Bush again.	1.0 You're just focusing on the past, gosh darn it. You gotta look to the future, like us team of mavericks.

EOS 1.0 Yeah, the whole Don't say that fathers don't know about caring for children, bit was the defining moment of the debate.	1.0 It really nullified her family focused campaign thus far, at least in my opinion.

1.0 stress that he's a christian EOS 1.0 HA he's a witness. raised that way but doesn't practice	1.0 I mean stress that Obama is a christian
1.0 Look your dad in the face, and say the following: Fuck you! Works every time. He has nothing else to top that.	1.0 He could say Fuck you plus a million . Follow up with Fuck you plus infinity for great success.
1.0 tell him you're voting for McCain and then go vote for the secret muslin.	1.0 Who wouldn't vote for a such versatile fabric!
1.0 I'm guessing your dad likes his alcohol. EOS 1.0 actually quite the opposite. He was a marine in nam and from that he learned to be very strict and, in spite of his flaws, is somewhat of a perfectionist	1.0 Makes me think of the military dad from American Beauty .
1.0 Did he sit you down to talk to you? Did he look you straight in the eye? Did he say you're no son. you're no son of miiiine... EOS 1.0 Well played. EOS 1.0 I don't understand, someone explain. edit: don't worry, asked all knowing google. I swear to god, sometimes it's like a replacement parent. EOS 1.0 The great music stylings of Genesis. Or was it after he went out on his own?	1.0 No Son of Mine from We Can't Dance, their last studio album with Phil.
1.0 And what would the mother say about this?	1.0 Hopefully 'Oh, finally, my flaming gay son is out of the closet' btw I'm not gay or nothin', this is just a scenario.
1.0 Don't they have like a neocon running for Prime Minister or something up there?	1.0 Yes, but our neo cons are more like American Liberals.
1.0 I just went to Vancouver Whistler. It is beautiful, but really expensive. Hope you have a stack of cash EOS 1.0 oooh, not so much cash atm...I hear B.C is where it's at. EOS 1.0 B.C. is where it is at, but holy fucking jesus it is expensive. Real good weed here.	1.0 If you live outside Vancouver the Lower Mainland then B.C. is a pretty cheap place to live. But I forgot, the rest of B.C. doesn't even exist to you people.
1.0 And for the slow kids, yes I live in the U.S. EOS 1.0 What about the NAU? You'd probably be better off going to Norway, Iceland, or something. EOS 1.0 that's what concerns me...canada is close though, and more feasible. I don't know norwegian...yet. just a touch of french spanish. EOS 1.0 You can learn a language, and you'll likely be learning one wherever you go. EOS 1.0 what's the cost of living in norway, if you know by any chance?	1.0 I don't.
1.0 And for the slow kids, yes I live in the U.S. EOS 1.0 What about the NAU? You'd probably be better off going to Norway, Iceland, or something. EOS 1.0 that's what concerns me...canada is close though, and more feasible. I don't know norwegian...yet. just a touch of french spanish. EOS 1.0 You can learn a language, and you'll likely be learning one wherever you go. EOS 1.0 what's the cost of living in norway, if you know by any chance?	1.0 It's high but so are salaries.
1.0 Without a bedroom? What does she do? Sleep on the kitchen table? EOS 1.0 It is a studio apartment, it is basically one room. The kitchen and living room, then there is a hallway and a small bathroom. Vancouver fucking sucks. hahaha	1.0 Oh! So, it's like a hotel room.
1.0 Alt Tab, Ctrl Insert, and Shift Insert EOS 1.0 You should defect to the Ctrl C and Ctrl V camp, Insert is for losers.	1.0 I guess old habits die hard.
1.0 In the US they like to be called African Americans. Well, what do they like to be called in the UK? Are they still considered a minority?	1.0 from cinema, i'd guess blacks .
1.0 In the US they like to be called African Americans. Well, what do they like to be called in the UK? Are they still considered a minority?	1.0 Black British has been banded about a few times.
1.0 in the UK, they don't need to give an entire race of people a demoralizing title, as everyone is different. EOS 1.0 Silence you inbred Scot!	1.0 I think the term you are looking for is Haggis chasing . If you're going to stereotype, at least do it right!
1.0 how is usar banned ? how spamer get raportid ?	1.0 i wish somebody would ban you.
1.0 not bad, kinda bored. how about you?	1.0 I'm chillin. about to have a look at some subreddits before hitting the sack.
1.0 r space and r bacon are all you need. My only ambition is to eat bacon in space.	1.0 no cat?
1.0 Happy Reddit. Because when things are getting too crazy fucked up sad disappointing on the rest of Reddit, Happy Reddit makes you feel just a little bit better about the world.	1.0 Although I've seen some pretty fucked up stories in the Happy Reddit.
1.0 Dear sweet Pasta in the sky. When did this train wreck happen? EOS 1.0 The scariest part is that it has over 400 subscribers...	1.0 Who are these people? What does a furry pun look like? Let's hope the gf doesn't catch me going through the comments. That might hard to explain.
1.0 Legally? There is no replacement. You can't refuse to accept American Currency anywhere in the United States. I'm also pretty sure you can't pay people in anything else.	1.0 Yup. Got you by the balls.
1.0 Burpees. Lots and Lots of Burpees.	1.0 Burpies are awesome. They combine pushups, squats, and jumping all in one motion. Also, stretching is very important. One should stretch for as long as the exercise.
1.0 100 push ups? EOS 1.0 I clicked just to see if this was posted yet. The sun is shining. I should really go outside. EOS 1.0 what is this outside of which you speak?	1.0 to me, it's opening my window and let the eager beam of light in.
1.0 Keg beats six pack. EOS 1.0 Agreed. It's what I planned to recommend when he was ready to go to the next level.	1.0 Woah, dude. You were planning on taking this to the next level?!
1.0 i'd like to spend 100 or less per person. trying to stay away from monogrammed flasks and other typical gifts like that. any ideas? thanks!	1.0 i gave mine TCB style diamond studded horshoe rings, but the wedding was at Graceland, so it fit the theme. sincerely, diggum
1.0 i'd like to spend 100 or less per person. trying to stay away from monogrammed flasks and other typical gifts like that. any ideas? thanks!	1.0 A friend of mine went to the used bookstore and bought us each a book that reminded him of us.
1.0 Get them each a nice switchblade.	1.0 Crazy thing is, I was just bestman in my brother wedding and he bought the groomsman nice switchblades.
1.0 Certainly not necessary, but most likely inevitable, given the way our minds work. EOS 1.0 If it was inevitable, how was it not necessary?	1.0 By not having a causal relationship with civilization. For example, farting is inevitable given human biology, but it is not a necessary precondition for the invention of the toilet.
1.0 Opiate of the masses?	1.0 This is what that saying refers to, yes.
1.0 So is Reddit a necessary component in the beginnings of an electronically networked society? Where would we be without it? EOS 1.0 I think you've hit the nail on the head. The coming collective consciousness is only peaking its head out of the digital birth canal.	1.0 I threw up a little but swallowed. I'm ok. I just had that image from Knocked Up.
1.0 Brainwashing helped him, and that's the cure he needs whether it comes from religion or psychology.	1.0 Sounds kind of snarky, but I agree and think it's true.
1.0 Issue loans to risky people.	1.0 You must also possess the ability to take action upon said risky people.
1.0 Call around, shop online. You'll eventually find a dealer that will break and give you a good deal.	1.0 Not only that, but play one dealer against another. We got a 2007 Honda Odyssey EX L new in 2007 for like 23,500 doing that.
1.0 Diamonds are carbon, and so can burn Diamonds are brittle, and so can shatter. The car and wall shatter. Depending on the engine type, it all catches on fire.	1.0 That sounds pretty awesome actually.
1.0 Wait, wait, I got it. A crash!	1.0 Nyuk! Nuyk! Yeah, because of physics!
1.0 They both spontaneously turn into coal? EOS 1.0 Other way around chief EOS 1.0 Coal into turn spontaneously both they? EOS 1.0 No ?laoc otni nrut ylsuoenatnops htob yehT	1.0 Oh, I have to show you people everything. l o o u u n lsno u uods oq
1.0 What happens when a unstoppable force hits an immovable object?	1.0 The unstoppable force goes on the run, and the immovable object gets sent to Arkham.
1.0 How about not checking Reddit during the day? I'll let you know how that goes.	1.0 Yes, I succeeded.
1.0 My step mother is dying and I'm going to go say goodbye to her even though I've always hated her...	1.0 You'll thank yourself someday for the effort, certainly.
1.0 I'm going to buy some weed. EOS 1.0 Finished. Now the rest of my day will comprise of smoking it and playing PS3.	1.0 You're awesome.
1.0 I'm going to buy some weed. EOS 1.0 i have loads! EOS 1.0 Live in DC? Pretty dry around here.	1.0 Tis sad
1.0 Aww, have a red letter and an upmod from someone who is only an hour out of sync, and who luckily gets to see the sun rise.	1.0 How kind of you : P
1.0 And visually distinguish it in some way.	1.0 .entry .op background color:
1.0 I have my comments sorted chronologically.	1.0 alphabetically comments have I my sorted.
1.0 what if they make multiple comments?	1.0 sticky the first one.
1.0 Having a blog is a requirement now for using reddit?	1.0 Reddit is not your blog.
1.0 Can't this just be prevented by down modding the post itself?	1.0 The question may be interesting and worthy of upvotes but the comment might be lame.
1.0 The fact that I had a hard time finding this comment illustrates the point. I wasn't even aware that there was more commentary on the post. EOS 1.0 Or, you could just sort by old, thus seeing the first comment posted to a story. EOS 1.0 Bah, that sounds like effort !	1.0 Right o lad.
1.0 Thanks for the tip! Good idea until Reddit takes this suggestion and incorporates it into their design. EOS 1.0 muahahahaha EOS 1.0 Pong anyone? .	1.0 .
1.0 am I the only one who doesn't have a problem finding the followup info?	1.0 sort by: old
1.0 Now were all gonna die in 7 days. Thanks	1.0 Actually, seeing as this is the internet, it should be a relatively easy task to show it to someone else before the time is up.
1.0 How did you have time to snap a picture?	1.0 DVR. Totally worth getting that. Tell your parents.
1.0 I have been exhibiting some less than flattering behavior recently. Have you dealt with sex addiction before? Serious redditors may only reply.	1.0 Whatever you do, don't do any bullshit 12 step program.
1.0 It might help to post the clinical definition.	1.0 God user took care of that in his post.
1.0 Man, that's a lame addiction. Have you ever sucked cock for sex ? NO ? You're not an addict ! EOS 1.0 Why would you suck cock for sex. Isn't that part of the sex process. EOS 1.0 Right. That's the joke.	1.0 Oh, wanna have sex?
1.0 We are nowhere near that point, Chicken Little.	1.0 You are, unfortunately, correct.
1.0 Too much time on reddit probably EOS 1.0 I think its safe to assume that anyone that posts on reddit spends too much time on it anyhow.	1.0 100 correct
1.0 I'm not so sure. Personally, I have a lot of problems that could be solved by someone else throwing money at them.	1.0 Well don't look at me.
1.0 I would enjoy having the sort by feature back, but we can't all get what we want. EOS 1.0 But if you try sometimes, you just might find... you get what you need! EOS 1.0 Not unless the mighty Reddit overlords can step down from their thrown for a minute to listen to what their users are asking.	1.0 Considering how broken the system is, it is still pretty damn good because of the community.
1.0 usually there's a view as text option. copy that and paste it into notepad or something	1.0 it still has to download the data... which is whats being blocked.
1.0 Why don't they just start naming torrent files .zip or .doc? EOS 1.0 Intelligent firewalls can analyze the data, not just the extension. EOS 1.0 Ok, well then cant they make the data look like those documents? or .jpgs?	1.0 They probably could, it's just not the way it's done currently.
1.0 lols I've hidden this submission	1.0 OMG LOL
1.0 How about they just fix the front page? EOS 1.0 Yes, they should employ 10000 sane, rational, intelligent people to vote up the good articles instead of leaving it to incompetent morons like us.	1.0 Indeed. Employment is the only way that 10000 sane, rational, intelligent people would frequent Reddit.
1.0 I really don't want to have to keep hiding things every day or so... EOS 1.0 24 7 168 How about we make it hidden for one week? EOS 1.0 Instead make down vote remove the post from your screen and HIDE for when you just want it gone forever.	1.0 You know they have that in preferences?
1.0 I use my real name because I just don't give a fuck.	1.0 You and I pray in the same pew.
1.0 I use my real name because I just don't give a fuck.	1.0 This, we can agree on Nate.
1.0 No Comment EOS 1.0 But that's a comment.	1.0 I can not confirm or deny that
1.0 Herman Hibelberg?	1.0 Hercules Bergkamp?
1.0 I wanted a guy's sn so you wouldn't immediately discredit me for being a chick. I only use this name here.	1.0 just to let you know, it would be awesome if all your comments were 'in character'.
1.0 let me put it this way: If you want to ask Vegeta what the scouter says about the DJIA, you should probably do it now.	1.0 Hate that you are starting to look right :
1.0 Sounds good, i bid...er....predict 8732!	1.0 1 dollar, Bob!
1.0 No. Face. EOS 1.0 holy shit, they haven't got any faces in jail either???	1.0 It's always in the face.

1.0 your mamma	1.0 I had the urge yesterday when I saw this thread to write exactly that. Glad I resisted...
1.0 My highschool sweetheart EOS 1.0 You met her once? Was this from behind the pot plant? Technically that isn't meeting.	1.0 Wow I guess my brain decided to skip the who you only met once part.
1.0 Care to share some of that advice? EOS 1.0 Don't do Drugs.	1.0 Drugs are bad, mmkay?
1.0 Care to share some of that advice? EOS 1.0 Don't do Drugs.	1.0 Don't do them, use them wildly
1.0 I met Isaac Asimov once 20 years ago.	1.0 I met Isaac Asimov once 20 years from now.
1.0 Are you sure she wasn't telling a joke?	1.0 From what I recall, it was told as a this really happened anecdote.
1.0 Seems like only celebrities and homeless people leave a memory after meeting them once.	1.0 mostly. but see my comment above.
1.0 Did you have wings and a halo? EOS 1.0 haha, no, but I might have had a syringe full of morphine!	1.0 sounds like an admission to me.
1.0 My abductor. I don't know his name. Oh, btw HELP!	1.0 Don't worry, as soon as I finish by Visual Basic GUI I will be able to track you IP address and rescue you! Hang on there!
1.0 He loves toys in the same way that hunters love deer urine. It's what they use to attract game.	1.0 I think he is genuinely deeply attracted to the innocence of childhood, and the kiddy fiddling stems from that, not vice versa.
1.0 Stan Lee. Edit: 'Nuff Said. EOS 1.0 Downvoted for the 'Nuff Said edit. I hate that phrase here it adds nothing.	1.0 See... Stan Lee invented 'Nuff Said ...
1.0 Did you have wings and a halo? EOS 1.0 More likely a black hooded robe and a sickle.	1.0 Halloween in hospices is always an opportunity for levity.
1.0 I can't say that anyone has really made an impression on me... ...all of you are just one long uninteresting blur. EOS 1.0 Aww, come 'ere you. You need a hug. EOS 1.0 I don't know about you, but I'd be freaked out if a pair of arms suddenly materialized out of a blur and tried to hug me.	1.0 But you'd never forget it.
1.0 I can't say that anyone has really made an impression on me... ...all of you are just one long uninteresting blur. EOS 1.0 Aww, come 'ere you. You need a hug. EOS 1.0 I don't know about you, but I'd be freaked out if a pair of arms suddenly materialized out of a blur and tried to hug me.	1.0 Especially scaly fishboy arms.
1.0 Care to share some of that advice? EOS 1.0 Probably Don't become a drug addict . EOS 1.0 That was part of it, yes. EOS 1.0 Very wise. EOS 1.0 I know it sounds trite, but it is true.	1.0 It's certainly made a lot of otherwise successful people pretty unhappy.
1.0 Who won?	1.0 He did, without making me feel bad about it. What a great, smart, funny guy he was.
1.0 ..I only didn't call because it was awkward. I can't believe you remember me, Ryan.. I currently live in Hinesville, where you at?	1.0 bash.org much?
1.0 This was a good self submission, adamjw. There are some really facinating responses here.	1.0 I do what I can.
1.0 Does anyone like that guy?	1.0 Even McCain gets the douche chills around that guy.
1.0 Does anyone like that guy?	1.0 Yeah seriously, what's his problem? It's like he's telling us some stupid story about someone he met once or something dumb like that.
1.0 ...and a lifetime of bitter regret!	1.0 ...with alcohol!
1.0 ..I only didn't call because it was awkward. I can't believe you remember me, Ryan.. I currently live in Hinesville, where you at? EOS 1.0 Now that's just cruel! EOS 1.0 What? No.. this is legit.. EOS 1.0 o O I'll be monitoring this thread to see if it deserves being bestof'd.	1.0 i concur
1.0 She must have seen you as a diamond. EOS 1.0 A crazy one, perhaps.	1.0 that was shiny even
1.0 I did, in Texas	1.0 Awesome! Glad to hear another Redditor had a similarly positive experience.
1.0 He just hasn't cashed his theoretical dollars.	1.0 don't be naive... they are internet dollars..pfft theoretical
1.0 John Elway is an asshole. EOS 1.0 He's much less of an asshole than most other professional athletes. He's also a better athlete than most of them.	1.0 Most? Hardly.
1.0 She sounds a bit creepy... EOS 1.0 I agree. That kind of willingness to change to please a man insane.	1.0 sex with crazy girls is pretty fucking crazy. just don't move in with them.
1.0 Hey that was a sweet story, no reason you had to sully it. Beat it!	1.0 You guys are Bad .
1.0 Carl Sagan. Although I only met him twice, I could tell a couple of amusing stories about him if anyone is interested. EOS 1.0 Dude, don't make us beg. EOS 1.0 I'm not above begging pleeeeeeeeease???	1.0 Yeah, holy shit, Carl we're stardust fucking Sagan hooks some brothers up with them stories!
1.0 Genuinely curious: why do you continue to patronize this pizza shop, long after it's abundantly clear that it's staffed by and frequented by inconsiderate twits? EOS 1.0 They probably have good pizza	1.0 It'd have to be one charming motherfucking pizza to deal with crap like this.
1.0 I'm not. I'm thinking Baldwin since he is the only person running that's using the Constitution as a guide.	1.0 Stephen or Alec? The other, lesser actors in the herd are too weak and cannot mount a challenge
1.0 I'm not. I'm thinking Baldwin since he is the only person running that's using the Constitution as a guide.	1.0 The Constitution Party is the socially hard right party. Nothing wrong with that if you like it, just want to make you aware of the fact.
1.0 There are more than two candidates. EDIT: In theory...	1.0 You must be new to America.
1.0 There are more than two candidates. EDIT: In theory...	1.0 And there are more issues.
1.0 I'll be voting for Bob Barr. But if it's really close between Obama and McCain, then I'll vote Obama. Palin scares me.	1.0 Is it the wink?
1.0 Voting for McCain. I'm not a trust fund child like most reddit goers so I don't have the luxury of having my small business taxed out the ass.	1.0 What the hell are you even talking about?
1.0 Voting for McCain. I'm not a trust fund child like most reddit goers so I don't have the luxury of having my small business taxed out the ass.	1.0 With Obama you'll pay more in taxes and with McCain you'll pay more in health care. Pretty much a no win for small business owners.
1.0 That one crazy bitch.	1.0 She's got some good votes in her voting history, though I don't like the 9 11 Truth stance that she's taken.
1.0 When your state is already in the bag for one candidate, your time is better spent having a beer. EOS 1.0 You must be from Massachusetts. EOS 1.0 No, IL.	1.0 Ah...we Massholes can do the same. I don't think MA has ever voted Republican.
1.0 Support the family structure!	1.0 Fag enabler.
1.0 lol sorry, you said history class and that's what came to mind. EOS 1.0 That would probably be okay in my science class, actually, were it related to science. My chemistry teacher is awesome. EOS 1.0 try searching YouTube for Look Around You , they're a series of odd, funny, fake ish science class style videos. All SFW, all funny. Also, try the Will it Blend series.	1.0 Yeah, already got those. The second season has some that aren't 100 SFW, like Computer Games where there's a lot of sexual innuendo. But generally, pretty SFW and funny, yeah.
1.0 Then, uh, ...isn't it a bit hypocritical to hate hypocrites?	1.0 lol.. meta morality. My point is everybody do hypocritical things every once in a while, but I try to catch myself and stop it if I can.
1.0 Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes. EOS 1.0 You should have had a semi colon in place of that comma in your last sentence. A coordinating conjunction or simply a semi colon is required for compound sentences.	1.0 It's a Walt Whitman quote. That's how he wrote it that's how I quoted it.
1.0 Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes. EOS 1.0 a witty saying proves nothing EOS 1.0 It's Walt Whitman, you doofus.	1.0 i know, hence, a witty saying
1.0 Why do you want to adjust the brightness so much ? Helps to have some background on the problem.	1.0 My reply is above. Thanks for trying to help.
1.0 Shes obviously trying to get someone to do her math homework for her. EOS 1.0 ...And the glowing bucket of goo?	1.0 There is some form of reptile in there I presume.
1.0 Foxmarks is awesome. It's switched me to Firefox from Opera. EOS 1.0 ... except that Opera 9.5 has a browser sync feature, that also syncs system prefs and saved passwords. Might I ask why you prefer Foxmarks?	1.0 I did not know that, perhaps I'll give it another shot.
1.0 Reddit is depressing in general.	1.0 Just a reflection on the world.
1.0 i am not superstitious, but i count things in 3's and like it when something can be counted perfectly in 3's	1.0 i like threesomes

1.0 So how is the experiment going?	1.0 Apparently not good. Reddit cannot be predicted.
1.0 Donate to non profit community agencies and programs. EOS 1.0 Already a large amount going to the Red Cross.	1.0 Fuck the Red Cross. Find small non profits that do not receive government money or funds from United Way.
1.0 Donate to non profit community agencies and programs. EOS 1.0 Already a large amount going to the Red Cross.	1.0 Hopefully the American Red Cross, at least. I hear bad things about the ICRC...

1.0 Two chicks at the same time.	1.0 Two chickens will produce three which produce five and so on... Afterwards you can start an agriculture business and rake in some real cash.
1.0 I was just about to say that he should buy shares in banks. Now I realise that he should just buy some banks !	1.0 That would be a pretty bad business decision.
1.0 You could lend me 10 bucks to buy gas so I can go apply for jobs farther away. EOS 1.0 Is there much of a baby eating market these days?	1.0 Hence the longer commute.
1.0 pffft 35,000 and counting here. Go stand at the back of the line	1.0 85K. Bite me.
1.0 Don't give to charity your money will be squandered by idiots. If you want to help out, invest in something that you are sure will efficiently help people.	1.0 Create your own charity and run it yourself like Bill Gates. That way you control the efficiency and evade taxes!
1.0 I may get a Solopipe. www.solopipe.com	1.0 That is not nearly baller enough for you.
1.0 Invest it, wait a decade or so, and then go to space . EOS 1.0 In this market it's more: invest it, wait a decade, eat some soup.	1.0 Soup! That's better than space.
1.0 Two chicks at the same time. EOS 1.0 Damn straight. I always wanted to do that, man. And I think if I were a millionaire I could hook that up, too 'cause chicks dig dudes with money. EOS 1.0 Well, not all chicks.	1.0 Kind of chicks that would double up on me.
1.0 A personal submarine!	1.0 Too small, you want a fleet at least.
1.0 You are the first millionaire that speaks to me. Cool.	1.0 Add me to the list.
1.0 And I stand behind your standing behind me. I leave those to a better understanding of physics or metaphors to figure that one out. EOS 1.0 I'm standing behind all of you and it's getting a little uncomfortable. EOS 1.0 That's because I ate burritos last night. EOS 1.0 Smells like roses.	1.0 Yes, that's because Rose is big on dairy and beans.
1.0 Wow nice work. Note to self: do not mess with p0ss	1.0 You're lucky you share a nick with a danish pop group :P.
1.0 What a coincidence your 49th comment would be about the number 49.	1.0 That is strange. I had no idea you could see comment numbering. . . How do you do it?
1.0 Bugatti Veyron.	1.0 Complete waste of money. I'd love to play with one for a a few weeks, but after a while the gas and upkeep would drown you.
1.0 it's not going anywhere any time soon... ...investing in the wasted husk of SOCX is the stock market equivalent of lighting your cigar with 100 bills.	1.0 Hey, someone'll buy it, someday.
1.0 Again, we're talking Canada. Even Canadian white trash has a working knowledge of world affairs, British literature, macro economics and American politics. EOS 1.0 Canadian white trash are referred to as Newfies.	1.0 Even if they aren't from new foundland
1.0 It isn't bad. Political rulers and their appointees are infinitely more qualified to manage the economy than pleebs like you.	1.0 i think your comment needs the following: Edit: sarcasm
1.0 Try going into a convenient store with the money from your monopoly set. Does it work? No. Now, pretend China is the convenient store. EOS 1.0 I'm not following your analogy. China actually does take our money. And how does that explain the bailout?	1.0 It doesn't explain the bailout it explains why the bailout is bad.
1.0 Try going into a convenient store with the money from your monopoly set. Does it work? No. Now, pretend China is the convenient store. EOS 1.0 I'm not following your analogy. China actually does take our money. And how does that explain the bailout? EOS 1.0 you asked for no technical language. EOS 1.0 I'm not the submitter. I'm more interested in how your analogy explains the bailout than how little technical language you used. EOS 1.0 google it	1.0 In other words: it doesn't.
1.0 Oh America, right. I should have guessed. It shouldn't surprise me that gambling is banned there too. Land of the free and all that.	1.0 You should see what happens if you show a nipple for 1 2 a second on national tv...

1.0 yeah, i watched a documentary or youtube video that explained how we are not actually citizens of the US, but rather citizens of our actual state..anybody know what that was?	1.0 You're a citizen of the US, and a resident of your state.
1.0 In North Dakota you don't need to register, all you need is a North Dakota drivers license.	1.0 Or state ID, or other picture ID and some other proof of address, or sign an oath and have a friend with their ID vouch for you.
1.0 In short, its called voter suppression and USA has had it since the beginning. In the early days of the USA, only white males who owned land could vote.	1.0 Very true, because you were based on British democracy which had similar rules. Only difference in that US was you could also vote for the executive, not just the legislative.
1.0 I'm Canadian, and I can show up at the polling station, register on the spot with ID and proof of residence, and vote ten minutes later.	1.0 And some states in the US offer that as well, though I'm certain you need to provide proof of citizenship, not just ID and proof of residence.

EOS 1.0 And, conversely, you don't have to have a driver's license or state ID to vote.	1.0 And those people might have to separately register to vote.

1.0 Your sentence was grammatically correct as far as I can tell. It was long but not a run on.	1.0 Ah, but he's developed a split infinitive It takes concentration to tip..., tap..., and not inhale... splits to inhale into two. Also, run on is not an acceptable substitute for run on .
1.0 Big League Chew. I would put it all in my mouth and make huge bubbles, although it always made my jaw hurt. ...none of that sentence sounds right.	1.0 Thats what she said.

1.0 Er, one could just edit the comment and replace it with garbage nothing before deleting it.	1.0 Then maybe we need an edit history as well.
1.0 So comment deletion doesn't work properly. Wonderful.	1.0 Comment deletion, searching, recommending... all from a website that's supposedly super hip when it comes to programming and web design.

1.0 I made fun of an upcoming movie based on Ayn Rand's kindergarten dystopian thriller Anthem and I got 17 points for it.	1.0 That is an accurate description of Ayn Rand's work.
1.0 I made fun of an upcoming movie based on Ayn Rand's kindergarten dystopian thriller Anthem and I got 17 points for it.	1.0 Aren't movies based on Rand's works always upcoming anyway? Ugh. That's exactly what we need.
1.0 6 for daring to suggest that Yahoo has become irrelevant. I'm still right. EOS 1.0 Seriously. Just going to the site looks like the internet barfed.	1.0 And now they're saying it was good luck on Balmer's part that the Yahoo deal fell through.
1.0 probably this comment right here.	1.0 i knew it.
1.0 I got a 3 for posting facts on a thread dealing with DRM. Facts are apparently not welcome in anti DRM threads. :P EOS 1.0 Facts are not welcome here any time they contradict what the mob knows is the truth.	1.0 You seem quite astute.
1.0 Well, I guess I deserve it for being a faux douche. EOS 1.0 Upmods all around for mindgames. Or am I.... EOS 1.0 Are you saying you are a mindgame? :p	1.0 Should have stopped while you were ahead. :c
1.0 I get that sometimes too. Some of the wankers on reddit seem a little Neanderthal. Usually I get downmodded, and told that Google is my friend.	1.0 But I get downmodded for asking questions that only that person can answer, like questions about personal experience.
1.0 whether the Earth orbits the Sun or the Sun orbits the Earth? But that is exactly the same behavior.	1.0 Interesting question. You'd have to ask a physicist why the smaller object is always said to be orbiting the larger one.
1.0 9 for making a statement against the sometimes sexist behavior culture on Reddit. I think it was on that How Girls Download Videos post. It only enforced my point. EOS 1.0 Agreed. The most downmods I've gotten is when I try to stop sexist behavior. I know how to call on my ladies to put a stop to the downmodding though. EOS 1.0 Your ladies? Why do you assume that anti sexist support has to only come from women?	1.0 I don't assume that. But on Reddit it's easier to find where the ladies gather than the anti sexist men. If you have suggestions, I'm listening.
1.0 Yes. Do it. Nobody will miss you.	1.0 I was trying to be funny. Now I feel bad. Don't do it.
1.0 I want a new laptop with multitouch, but I'd prefer to stick with Windows. Anybody have an idea when the twine shall meet?	1.0 isn't that a software feature? I mean, don't most modern trackpads have the ability?
1.0 I've got a good recommendation for you if you're interested.	1.0 I'd like to hear it too, although it would take a while for me to follow up on it.

1.0 Because those are the buzzwords employed by communist regimes. As for why no communist regime is democratic... read Hayek's Road to Serfdom	1.0 Mainly because communist is often used as a synonym for undemocratic by careless polemists.

EOS 1.0 i do believe that the whole 'bacons fat will kill you' thing is just a horrible myth. and that it will actually give you a longer lifespan.	1.0 I agree. It is all just a scam perpetrated by bacon grubbing elitists. How could bacon possibly clog your arteries when it is so greasy?
1.0 Lobster is overrated, IMO. King Crab legs, on the other hand, are fantastic. EOS 1.0 He's right. Lobster, while I find very yummy, is way over rated over priced. EOS 1.0 Over priced is relative. It all depends on where you get them. I was paying 10 each this last summer. It helps if you live in northeastern Mass.	1.0 I used to get the twin lobster special at SkipJacks in Harvard Square for 12.95. Heaven.

1.0 Is anyone else wondering why so many prisoners want Dr. Pepper? EOS 1.0 I think Dr Pepper is more popular in the South, and these inmates were all in Texas. Just a guess though.	1.0 Texas does have the lion's share of executions, that's for sure.

1.0 shudder Equating the 'lobster' at Red Lobster is like eating a McRib and thinking it's slow cooked southern bbq ribs.	1.0 Or eating General Tso's chicken and thinking it's chicken.

1.0 Funny guy. That someone would be a fellow inmate, not your captors. EOS 1.0 Really? That doesn't count as cruel and unusual punishment? EOS 1.0 No. Being a custodial engineer is usually preferred over sitting in your cell. Trustees do almost all of the menial labor at a prison.	1.0 Interesting. I initially imagined them having to clean up the actual corpse for some reason. But I guess if they volunteer to do it, it doesn't make a difference.

1.0 Cheeseburger, side of fries, and a cup full of water from the Fountain of Youth served in the Holy Grail. EOS 1.0 You chose...wisely.

1.0 jesus, stop trolling baiting. again, dirtymoney, if you yourself aren't trolling baiting, drinking distilled water is safe.	1.0 Seriously, it isn't funny to troll by calling other people trolls. It just confuses everyone, and, in the end, may cause this poor kid the use of his kidneys.
1.0 4chan, at least it's better than Yahoo Answers. EOS 1.0 I don't know... Yahoo Answers won't rape you and post pictured of your severed dick being grilled and eaten, even if you ask how is babby formed . EOS 1.0 I missed that thread, is it cached somewhere? EDIT: Rapidshare?	1.0 Yeah, but Rapidshare took it down.

1.0 You both describe a syndrome that sounds similar to alcohol dehydrogenase deficiency. It occurs most often in people of Asian decent but is sometimes found in other ethnicities.	1.0 Are you a real doctor? Either way, thanks for a name for the thing my wife experiences!
1.0 true. but a nice thing about the natural things vs synthetic is that the natural things usually have a nice long track record that you can look at. EOS 1.0 Cocaine isn't synthetic by the way. Its extracted but not synthetic. EOS 1.0 It isn't natural though, because the extraction process involves soaking it in ether and later kerosene. EOS 1.0 You can extract hash by using rubbing alcohol, does that make it not natural?	1.0 well, it's not naturally occuring. but you could argue that neither is marijuana smoke.
1.0 Well, you can start by learning better grammar.	1.0 Your a idiot.

1.0 married with children the fresh prince of bel air	1.0 Hey, look at this guy! Cryogenics worked.
1.0 I think FX's It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia would fit into that list quite nicely. Also, Mad Men is an awesome show. EOS 1.0 Gotta agree with the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia recommendation. A few friends and I watched the whole series a few weeks ago and now we're hooked.	1.0 Best show on television that no one is watching.
1.0 A vote for who you want to be President is a vote for that person regardless.	1.0 Yup...there are already too many people thinking, My vote won't count You need to get up regardless of the experts saying Obama already won.
1.0 You should vote whether or not you think your vote will count . Exercise your constitutional rights.	1.0 I have the constitutional right not to vote.
1.0 I'm in the most red state and I still vote. Your local elections count as well.	1.0 Utah, right?
1.0 You should be ashamed for asking that question. EOS 1.0 Really, he should. Local elections are important too! I'm not voting only because I want to cast my vote for Obama.	1.0 Yeah, except his question was, specifically, whether it was worth it for him to vote for President.
1.0 You should be ashamed for asking that question. EOS 1.0 You should understand the electoral college. EOS 1.0 I fully understand the electoral college. You need to widen your scope and see that an election isn't just about voting for one candidate over another.	1.0 Yeah, it's about not voting for one candidate over another.
1.0 No. Bring on the downmods. EOS 1.0 Local elections? We also need a democratically controlled congress in excess of 60 members to effectively put policy through.	1.0 That's not the question, though. The question was specifically is it worth it for him to vote for President .
1.0 I'm in the most red state and I still vote. Your local elections count as well. EOS 1.0 By population or concentration? EOS 1.0 By percentage of people that support McCain. EOS 1.0 so concentration? Mississippi?	1.0 Oklahoma was the highest last time I saw at 66
1.0 There are a lot of cool apps out there which run a lot better than windows counter parts. Have a google search for apps you may want to run.	1.0 www.macupdate.com is the best source for applications

1.0 Nothing at all. Enjoy your waste of a grand.	1.0 Except you get to run OS X instead of a POS Windows OS. Worth the premium to me.
1.0 Actually I use it when reading articles or text documents. I find white on black much easier to read than black on white.	1.0 Besides improving many background text color combos, inversion reduces eyestrain when working in the dark.

1.0 Yes. A great unstated awesome thing about the Mac is how unified it is. Commands for one app are the same in every other app.	1.0 If the app follows the human interface guidelines. Unfortunately Apple itself broke some in the switch to OS X.

1.0 ctrl command D in safari while the cursor is over a word. EOS 1.0 Or in any other application too.	1.0 Yes. Another great thing about the Mac: a lot of the things, like dictionary and spellcheck, run across all applications.
1.0 It has this really neat feature where it turns you into an arsehole. I think it runs on startup. EOS 1.0 Theory: The typical pretentious mac user attitude is preemptive since every non mac user seems to think its their job to tell you how much your computer sucks. EOS 1.0 I would like to verify this one. The only asshole larger than a Mac asshole is an anti Mac asshole. Mac users get used to this and learn to preempt. EOS 1.0 The thing I've learned since getting a Mac is that for everything that it does better than a computer running XP, there is one thing that XP does better.	1.0 The Virus Checker runs really well in XP! D
1.0 No, it's more like I don't get why people think the second Batman film is anything but mediocre.	1.0 Batman Returns wasn't great. But Michelle Pfeiffer was pretty good in it.
1.0 Have you tried it in a sunny location? I was just using my laptop in the park over lunch thanks to this feature.	1.0 ? In a sunny location, I turn my backlight off because I can see fine without it.

1.0 He said he was from an emerging economy . No way in hell I'd recommend that he sign up for 3rd world military duty.	1.0 Have you been watching the dow?? Maybe he thinks the U.S. is an emerging economy. Good point though... At some point in this thread I started talking to hax0r.
1.0 Air Force wouldn't take you. EOS 1.0 Why not? EOS 1.0 Physical fitness and your age. EOS 1.0 What does either of those things have to do with my IT skills and experience?

1.0 I think there are companies you can pay who will pretend to be your former employer. EOS 1.0 Now THAT is a fantastic Business idea!	1.0 It's called Vandelay Industries!
1.0 Say you were traveling the world. Get a job in the oil industry, they can't get enough engineers.	1.0 Alberta, Canada. PhD in elec engg? No prob, buddy! Submit your resumes now!
1.0 Join the military? EOS 1.0 He's got a PhD. I doubt he's stupid enough to join the military. EOS 1.0 He's mentally ill.	1.0 Doesn't mean he's stupid.
1.0 Actually the perfect excuse for gaps in your resume is to say you were self employed.	1.0 Which, of course, should be written in your resume.
1.0 Will not mentioning the PhD be problematic if they find out that he has one?	1.0 They'd hesitate to fire you, I'd imagine, even if it may count against you while hiring.
1.0 Brazil. Now that I ve recovered my mental faculties, I have no idea how to face some important people from my ex life. This is going to be a looooong hard road.	1.0 Can you afford to leave if need be?
1.0 Actually the perfect excuse for gaps in your resume is to say you were self employed. EOS 1.0 Do employers actually fall for that? I've always imagined they look at it and go, Hur hur. 'Self employed'. EOS 1.0 Hell yes they do. You just have to get your story straight. Personally, I prefer half truths. Help your neighbor install some solar panels Green energy startup .	1.0 Greatest idea I've heard recently is to put up a webpage and, depending on your discipline, write a tutorial, contribute to an open source project, or whatever. Bam! Instant small business!

1.0 Chain him down there and make him your bitch.	1.0 I like where your head is, but I also think Dad would be at the very bottom of a long list of potential candidates for the position of chained up bitch.
1.0 What'd you do? Did he die?	1.0 Yeah, he died when I was 22. He drank about a twelve pack or more a day.
1.0 You don't fix him you insure him.	1.0 Ah cynicism, I knew you were lurking in here somewhere... Good luck getting reasonable premiums on that. P
1.0 You don't fix him you insure him. EOS 1.0 Scoff You really think you'd be able to get a decent life insurance policy with someone who has the problems this guy allegedly has?	1.0 If you're willing to insure your dad instead of helping him stop self destructive behaviour, lying on the insurance application is surely the lesser of two evils.
1.0 Are you saying the dad's best therapist is himself? I don't think that will work well. EOS 1.0 The best potential therapist is himself, but he chooses not to give himself that therapy.	1.0 Therefore a therapist is necessary. How will a mentally unhealthy person help themselves mentally?
1.0 If you're a fan of Winamp already, just download an older version of Winamp Lite.	1.0 Christ, how didn't I think of that? Got old Winamp amp VLC I'll test 'em both out for a while. Thanks, AskReddit, you've done it again!

1.0 4. But don't hate me anonymgrl. I adore you. EOS 1.0 came to mind before I even read the questions.	1.0 Same here. If a guy starts buying tampons he will grow boobs in time, and his penis will shrivel and die.

1.0 I don't get it... why is buying tampons for your girlfriend considered being whipped ? Where's the shame in buying it for them if you're already out? It's called being considerate. EOS 1.0 OP specifically states he went to the store in order to buy her tampons.	1.0 Cashier wouldn't know that, though.

EOS 1.0 OP specifically states he went to the store in order to buy her tampons.	1.0 I still don't see how that's different than going to pick something else up for her.
1.0 Not to sound rude but why?	1.0 I'm a commitment guy? It's clearly a joke, but I have to be pretty devoted to a girl before I will run out for tampons.
1.0 Agreed. It's not exactly that your boyfriend is whipped but more that the clerk perceives tampon purchases as a symptom of a stereotypically bad relationship trajectory.	1.0 Being comfortable around the girl bad relationship trajectory ?? Confused.
1.0 I personally would feel weird in this regard about everything except the lotion. I'd feel weird about the lotion for other reasons.	1.0 Ok, thanks for being honest. I don't understand it, but appreciate the honesty.
1.0 I personally would feel weird in this regard about everything except the lotion. I'd feel weird about the lotion for other reasons.	1.0 Well, wait, hypothetically, how would you feel about going in to buy... um... a jar of Vaseline, a plunger, some dog treats, and a bottle of the hottest salsa ???

1.0 What the hell is a tampon? EOS 1.0 It's an ice climbing ax.	1.0 You know, when it's that time of the month, my girlfriend gets horrible crampons.
1.0 my boyfriend is the opposite. he refuses to buy them. his logic is that this is my responsibility as a woman to take care of my own body.	1.0 That's stupid, it's not like you're asking him to insert it for you.
1.0 Indian hair tampons: Natural is best. EOS 1.0 the nausea is so strong i wonder if it is morning sickness.	1.0 Nighttime sickness here.
1.0 They're called nickles.	1.0 Only if you're in the US, and also, isn't it nickels ?
1.0 That reminds me of this girl on cam4 who pulled out a fresh tampon and licked the shit,er, blood, out of it.	1.0 pix or it didn't happen
1.0 I would reccomend doing the first regardless, there are always shortages of blood.	1.0 there are always shortages of whole blood not plasma so much. I believe most plasma is used for medical research, which is why they pay money for it.
1.0 talk us all into bailing you out. EOS 1.0 from what I understand, you as a citizen don't have a lot of say in who does and doesn't get bailed out. EOS 1.0 Then why'd ya ask?	1.0 I was joking, as in the majority of america didn't want the bailout to pass and it did.
1.0 talk us all into bailing you out. EOS 1.0 In college I generally got my parents to bail me out. It worked pretty well. EOS 1.0 Friends do it too.	1.0 Friends I had to pay back.

1.0 Yeah, but why are they going to listen to complaints from someone who isn't even registered to vote?	1.0 Our representatives know NONE of our views until we tell them. Write letters, call their phone numbers, try to talk to them at ralleys. It is worth it.
1.0 I find ridiculous that US citizen don't have ID Cards and have to identify themselves with unopened mail or stuff like that.	1.0 I am glad we don't have ID cards.

It's not about the age, it's whether or not you're a winner or a loser.	1.0 That'd be me, except I gave up at 18 and now spend all my time at reddit.
1.0 Brb, have to go floss. EOS 1.0 Periodontal disease is no laughing matter.	1.0 If you neglect it, it will come back and bite you in the ass.
1.0 If you get paid to do what you love, then you are set for life. I'll gladly do it pro bono. EOS 1.0 goddammit, CSI, i have only so many upmods to give	1.0 Careful CSI turns upmods into Visual Basic GUIs.
1.0 If you can be passionate about exercise that's great, but you don't have to get excited in order to take a walk for half an hour.	1.0 Well put. Certainly shorter than my ramble. Thanks.
1.0 I confirm that if you're a man, a great woman is the single most important thing in live. EOS 1.0 most truthful comment ever the grammar nazi in me wishes you had spelled 'life' correctly... EOS 1.0 I confirm that if you're a grammar Nazi, proper capitalization of Nazi is the single most important hting. EOS 1.0 I can neither confirm nor deny if you misspelled thing on purpose	1.0 Meme killer! Without an error, the induction step cannot continue!
1.0 In other words, don't bother trying to find any strength within yourself. Just get somebody else to fix you! EOS 1.0 Some things just require two people to really be effective. The Tango, for instance. EOS 1.0 And minimalist tug of war.	1.0 Real minimalist tug of war only needs one person, and it's probably still OK without him.
1.0 It's really fucking weird to vote up such a naked post.	1.0 Just imagine he's quoting from a TV show where all the best lines are delivered by paper cutout children or something.
1.0 This is relevant to my interests. I turn 29 in two days. EOS 1.0 I turned 28 yesterday, so yeah. I've been in a bit of a funk the past couple of days for getting older with nothing to show for it. EOS 1.0 Aging underachievers of the world unite!	1.0 Plorf wants to know when it's time to grow up.
1.0 Oh, I'm right here, hiding in my room, downloadin' some porn.	1.0 So, I think, are they.
1.0 If you're a single guy, enticing the neighborhood kids with something even as innocent as a BBQ doesn't seem like a good idea in these pedo paranoid days. EOS 1.0 Wow, didn't think of that. But you're right.	1.0 It's a sad world we live in. In America today, it seems to be: 1. All pedos have penises. 2. Men have penises. 3. Therefore all men are pedos.
1.0 Always plead not guilty. And request a trial by JURY, not bench trial.	1.0 They have the burden of proof, so unless they can offer evidence of you drinking, this is really the best option.
1.0 I would ask a lawyer. You don't know who is giving you advice here on reddit.	1.0 Don't get a court appointed lawyer.
1.0 If your comments aren't showing up, you should change the toner cartridge in your keyboard. Look on the bottom.	1.0 Well, it's not technically my comment, so I should probably ask my friend to change her keyboard toner cartridge, right?
1.0 BTW, I think there are names derived from Welsh where the vowel is written as w too.	1.0 cwm and crwth are the commonest welsh imports
1.0 Cwmru is a whole goddam country, part of the United Kingdom. Never heard of it? Alternatively, what's the role of w in the diphthong ow? EOS 1.0 Who taught you to take God's name in vain, your parents? Or did you learn this on your own?	1.0 Actually, I got goddam and whole lot of other exclamations from your dad If I recall it correctly, I was demonstrating how to sodomize your mother.
1.0 You can't write vowel without using W as one.	1.0 That kinda depends on your accent. Anyway the distinction between a consonant and a vowel is not orthographic, it's phonetic. English spelling is not strictly phonetic.
1.0 Oh my, why don't you try to think of one your self?	1.0 Qwt. As in, I qwt my job.
1.0 Ack. The only welsh I know I learned watching Dr. Who.	1.0 That would be Dr. Whw.

1.0 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z	1.0 That's a whole new way of looking at the alphabet. Revolutionary!
1.0 Diphthongs are still vowels, and w can be a diphthong sometimes: ergo, w is sometimes a vowel.	1.0 Look at the word: cwm An awesome word.
1.0 Stop. Hammertime	1.0 Can't stop, addicted to the shin dig.
1.0 I wish I had the balls to write all my Reddit posts in IPA.	1.0 Shit, do I even have to check if someone has registered the redditIPAposter ?

1.0 funny that...i'm 52 and was always taught that the vowels are a,e,i,o,u and sometimes y and w. ...go figger... shrug EOS 1.0 You were also taught that nothing can go faster than the speed of light.	1.0 and that Pluto was a planet.
1.0 Sure, now how do you pronounce Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch again?	1.0 I don't.
1.0 Sure, now how do you pronounce Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch again?	1.0 Four L s in a row? That's fucked up, man. Fucked. Up.
1.0 It was originally pweened, thanks to Fargo from PlanetQuake. I don't care how many people call it powned, it's still going to be pronounced pweened, in my mind.	1.0 I upmodded you, but only in your mind.
1.0 This thread just blew my mind. I had no idea w could by a vowel. My life just got flip turned upside down. EOS 1.0 If your life got flip turned upside down, m is now a vowel.	1.0 Good, now we know what the vowel is in the second syllable of rhythm.
1.0 using w as a vowel is perfectly cromulent. EOS 1.0 A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man! EOS 1.0 Funny. I never heard anyone say embiggens before I moved to Springfield... EOS 1.0 Did you move there in Smarch?	1.0 lousy smarch weather...
1.0 Count me as one of the 75 . I have never heard of it before. EOS 1.0 Possibly because it's stupid?	1.0 I bet he's heard a lot of stupid things before.
1.0 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z EOS 1.0 Perhaps I'm an idiot, but WTF are you doing? EOS 1.0 First letter in each line is a vowel.	1.0 How the hell did I miss that? I think I just failed at everything.

1.0 Look up rounding on Wikipedia. You'll be blown away at how many different rounding algorithms there are.	1.0 I did and I was
1.0 I say k li	1.0 Yeah, I definitely say that when I say it quickly, but I could at least see myself saying k u li , whereas ktu li is right out.
1.0 I say k li	1.0 I pronounce it kt uli or ack chew lee
1.0 The p in pwn is pronounced as an o in that context. Just ask Doug.	1.0 I think it's dialectal. I usually hear it pronounced pown, rhymes with moan.
1.0 You talk like a fag, and your shit's all retarded.	1.0 go f k jo s lf, d k s.
1.0 To quote, English doesn t borrow from other languages. English follows other languages down dark alleys, knocks them over and goes through their pockets for loose grammar.	1.0 It's not just the languages.
1.0 College will always be there... youth won't. Take the time. I wish I had.	1.0 One size does not fit all.
1.0 By the age of 17 you pretty much know everything anyway so why listen to anyone elses advice.	1.0 I think his plan is to save all the advice for when he's 22, then he'll put it to use.
1.0 My parents wouldn't be paying for it, and living on my own has nothing to do with it.	1.0 Hmm I don't know. Just do what you feel is right.
1.0 Frankly, I think your restaurant sounds great and there should be more like it.	1.0 Thank you.

1.0 I broke up with a girlfriend because she didn't like Arrested Development. She said it was dumb and she didn't get it . I had to end it right there.	1.0 not trivial, as it points to a larger, systemic problem directly related to her sense of humor and ability to detect awesomeness.

1.0 I broke up with a girlfriend because she didn't like Arrested Development. She said it was dumb and she didn't get it . I had to end it right there. EOS 1.0 That's trivial? I beg to differ. EOS 1.0 Grounds for divorce , I say. EOS 1.0 Yeah, I'd say that would give you license to bolt in the night to Sacremende. EOS 1.0 I know you're lying, because I did a Google search and it says there is no Sacramende! EOS 1.0 Fine! I'll live it up ole South American style and go to Portugal! EOS 1.0 I just Blue myself!

1.0 She loooooooooved musicals. I hated them with a passion.	1.0 So did I until I saw one with the actor who played Centauri in The Last Starfighter. That legitimized them for me.
1.0 Her order at a restaurant: Ranch Roll up Ranch fries, amp a side of Ranch. Fail. EOS 1.0 That sounds like a comedy. Whats wrong with that order? EOS 1.0 In either ascending or descending order, that would be Ranch, Ranch, and Ranch. Eughhhhh.	1.0 Lovely Ranch! Wonderful Ranch!

1.0 So... who are the fundamentally BAD people whom we can justifiably kill and invade because they are fundamentally BAD, no matter how they are governed?	1.0 I don't know that there are fundamentally bad people, as a group. There are probably fundamentally bad people as individuals.

EOS 1.0 If he wins, then he'll probably save the funds for his reelection campaign, or help settle Hillary's debt. EOS 1.0 I think there wa a pretty big outcry about him paying off Hillary's debt before, so I don't think that'll be it.	1.0 McCain Feingold campaign finance reform prohibits using the funds to pay off someone else's campaign debt.

1.0 Look, if you love him, then sex him. It's not that complicated. EOS 1.0 I don't love him! That's the problem! I am in love with Jesus not Jesus !	1.0 We understand. It is confusing to be young and in love. The uncertainty, awkwardness, raging hormones....it can be difficult to cope with.
1.0 Look, if you love him, then sex him. It's not that complicated. EOS 1.0 I don't love him! That's the problem! I am in love with Jesus not Jesus !	1.0 Yeah, but someone ganked his username. If you aren't sure if he's Jesus, ask him for a sign.

1.0 Reading on the toilet may lead to hemorrhoids. EOS 1.0 How come?	1.0 Via wiki: Sitting for prolonged periods of time can cause hemorrhoids. Poor muscle tone or poor posture can result in too much pressure on the rectal veins.

1.0 I did, but there's no GUI so I can't set it up : EOS 1.0 What? It's all GUI. Everything is done through the GUI.

1.0 well wouldn't it be fun to take a lot of atheists and go picket their place?	1.0 Only if the signs were giant full color photos of gay sex. Tastefully censored for legal purposes, of course. 24 7 365 vigil.
1.0 well wouldn't it be fun to take a lot of atheists and go picket their place?	1.0 I'm a Christian and I would join you.
1.0 Wait what's going on with this church?	1.0 Someone thought it would be funny to create the worst place in north america.
1.0 Don't feed the trolls bro.	1.0 Not feeding the trolls. Trolling the trolls.
1.0 One Word. Rickroll.	1.0 If we can project a Rickroll onto the side of their building from across the street, that would be good. Of course, by Rickroll, I mean Meatspin.
1.0 Nope, always known they were mostly idiots.	1.0 You say that as if there is some country somewhere that isn't.
1.0 Yes, I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, for a black democrat with an Arab name and Muslim ties to win with such a huge margin, who'd have thunk it?	1.0 Thank god for Palin!
1.0 No, because some Americans still voted for the other guy. Also, I still haven't seen any changes, so I remain skeptical. EOS 1.0 To be fair he isn't actually the president yet... EOS 1.0 To be fair, discounting other people's choice is pretty up there in terms of jackassitude... EOS 1.0 ? I was responding to his second point actually. EOS 1.0 I felt like making a meme EOS 1.0 To be fair, it isn't an easy thing to do... EOS 1.0 To be fair, I admire the efforts of both of you anyway. EOS 1.0 Making memes is hard. Let's go shopping.	1.0 I bet I could shop for 100 memes.
1.0 Just so you know, I'm not Canadian. I upvoted because I feel bad for you guys that the U.S. is getting all the attention in terms of politics.	1.0 ...like we always do. The luxury of being a world superpower.
1.0 Now, are we talking about a hunting permit here, or a live moose. Because I don't have much use for a dead one.	1.0 Live, most definitely live. I do believe that was a large part of the point of it, so that they didn't have to cull them.
1.0 I've just always liked the song. Even before the massive exposure.	1.0 Maybe we should make this our new national anthem.
1.0 A friend of mine has it as his ringback tone so every time someone calls him, they hear it. I like calling him.	1.0 I have it as my voicemail message. So every time I miss a call some one gets rolled
1.0 Love the song but downvoted for vote up if . EOS 1.0 Agreed. This shouldn't be encouraged. I'm always sad when I see a vote up if topping the list. EOS 1.0 You do realize that there's an AskReddit subreddit that you can unsubscribe from?	1.0 Yes, and I also realise that this subreddit has good stuff in it.
1.0 And a rickroll to everyone around you. Awesome! EOS 1.0 Why do people think if you force someone to hear the song it is a rickroll? I always believed a true rickroll is tricking someone to listen to the song.	1.0 Yeah, I think you would have to hack their phones and change their ringtone.
1.0 Im thinking the cost of food should drop back down since gas isnt outrageous anymore. Greedy corporate fucks. Why did gas go down in price anyway?	1.0 Because Obama promised change.
1.0 Is there a spelling podcast? You'd probably like that one.	1.0 Yeah, I probably would.
1.0 This American Life and Free Talk Live. You need the full spectrum and these are at opposite ends. EOS 1.0 I just picked up This American Life, I'm going to try out Free Talk Live now. EOS 1.0 Thanks for keeping me posted. I'd love to hear what you think of both. EOS 1.0 I definitely like This American Life more than Free Talk Live, though I've only listened to a handful of either.	1.0 Free Talk Live may grow on you but some days it will totally grate.
1.0 This bothered me when I started reddit, but then I learned that timing, luck and a well crafted title are all part of the game.	1.0 You mean titles like Vote up if and Top ten ?
1.0 Why do you care if your link gets noticed?	1.0 Can't you tell from the title of my post that I am a desperate attention seeker?
1.0 Nope. I've been on reddit for years never submitted a link. Does that make me a bad redditor?	1.0 Honestly I think comments are more the soul of Reddit than links, although the links do provide the comments.
1.0 Nope. I've been on reddit for years never submitted a link. Does that make me a bad redditor?	1.0 It makes you a readditor.
1.0 I reckon that when you get a couple of immediate down votes it certainly doesn't help.	1.0 Yep, this democratized Web stuff really clearly demonstrates the phenomenon.
1.0 This happened to me repeatedly when I was on digg, so much so that I finally stopped submitting.	1.0 This never happens on digg. That's why we keep constantly losing redditors to the vastly superior digg.
1.0 If it's the same title, it's annoying. But usually it's a different title, and part of the process of learning how to write better reddit titles.	1.0 I agree wholeheartedly.
1.0 This bothered me when I started reddit, but then I learned that timing, luck and a well crafted title are all part of the game. EOS 1.0 timing, luck and a well crafted title Bingo. EOS 1.0 Dammit! I needed timing, luck and lots of friends on my bingo card.	1.0 Wow, that was an amazing response.
1.0 I'm sorry , but I'm constantly made fun of by reddit users about my beliefs yet you don't see me complaining!	1.0 Your just all over the place arncha? Good stuff, I like your work.
1.0 Why the hell would anyone want to subject themselves to the indignity of begging for spare change if they didn't have to?	1.0 Because it makes big tax free dollars?
1.0 I said, Sorry, to one guy at Pioneer Square, and he called me Satan. I thought that was a bit over the top.	1.0 You should've asked for his soul.
1.0 At least one guy where I live is honest about where the money is going. His cardboard sign says Need Beer . EOS 1.0 I had just left the beer store once, and was driving through downtown. I saw a guy with this sign, and handed him one out the window...He lit right up.	1.0 Meth or weed?
1.0 Worst excuse ever. Fatal stabbing during robbery by gang of homeless imminent. EOS 1.0 Homeless gang of knife wielding robbers all shot dead by ccw permit holder.	1.0 Former CCW permit holder indicted by Attorney General John Edwards on federal concealed weapons charges.
1.0 I live in rural Nova Scotia... what's a street person ?	1.0 It's like a hooker, but you don't get anything for your money.
1.0 Each situation is different. Some people really need that money.	1.0 No, they need help. That money will serve them better by going to soup kitchens, housing programs, job training, mental health resources, detox and rehab centers, etc.
1.0 I agree. Who are we to judge? Who's to say if we were living on the streets we wouldn't pick up those sort of habits?	1.0 Although it usually goes the other direction.
1.0 If you ever become homeless I'm going to stick up my nose when you reach your hand out, because the system always works.	1.0 Fair enough. If you ever become homeless I'll donate 100 to a charity of your choice.
1.0 Same as before: Bacon Jellybean	1.0 Bacon Jellybean Obama.
1.0 She's calico with super long fur. She actually kind of looks like a gremlin but we ruled that out. Something feminine but fun.	1.0 Mistress Floofypants. Miss Floof for short.
1.0 Pic of the cat and sex, would be helpful. Rover, woofy, Socrates EOS 1.0 Sex is always helpful but she's only asking you to name a frigging cat. EOS 1.0 How do you know the OP is female? Are you judging cat lovers?	1.0 Her username is madelinecn. Madeline is a girls name.
1.0 I know a girl who is absolutely horrified by toenails, not feet toenails. Another lady I used to know would become faint anytime she heard Scranton, Pennsylvania .	1.0 I'm taking it she can't watch The Office. Edit: And she wouldn't vote for Obama Biden.
1.0 I think this is reasonably spartan.	1.0 THIS! IS! ...pretty reasonable, actually.
1.0 The new subreddit subscription screen is a bit flashy, no? Could do with some reflections though. EOS 1.0 I agree. It's too flashy. It needs to be more flashy.	1.0 Needs more cowbell
1.0 I think this is reasonably spartan. EOS 1.0 Which one was he?	1.0 Probably not one of the 300. They knew they were doomed but fought anyway, thus making them clearly unreasonable.
1.0 How do you do it, my hero?	1.0 From my list, it looks like it's sorted by frequency of visit. So... go knock yourself out.
1.0 Yeah, why the fuck should it list reddits I don't subscribe to? EOS 1.0 lets you know what's out there. i like it.	1.0 That might be useful if it showed random maybe not yet popular reddits, but it just shows the same top 20 or so.
1.0 Yeah, why the fuck should it list reddits I don't subscribe to? EOS 1.0 lets you know what's out there. i like it.	1.0 I wouldn't mind some sort of separator though, such as a in between ones I'm subbed to and ones I'm not
1.0 Apparently, they are the subreddits you read the most.	1.0 Oh god. I read Linux the most? I'm a geek
1.0 Apparently, they are the subreddits you read the most.	1.0 I never would have thought Politics would be my forth and Ask Reddit is my first.
1.0 How is releasing on a Friday ballsy? Companies and governments always release their shitty info on Fridays so it gets lost in the weekend. EOS 1.0 Because if there's a bug or massive user revolt, you're stuck developing a fix over Friday night and the weekend with less available resources	1.0 I'm pretty sure you get to develop a fix with just as many resources, if not more, over the weekend, assuming that by resources you mean alcohol.
1.0 It probably takes at least a few days to be accurate, they just implemented it this afternoon and weren't tracking it before.	1.0 Yeah, I know. But in the mean time.... :p
1.0 all.reddit.com FTW.	1.0 Oh yes.
1.0 It was all caps before, too.	1.0 And down there on the right it was fine. On top above everything else, not as much.
1.0 I also like Tool, and I listen to Marilyn Manson a bit. Flobots are pretty cool too. My problem is that this is almost everything I have in my library.	1.0 Have you tried Last.fm? Their recommendations are usually pretty good.
1.0 Try Pandora.com radio, usually gives me things that match my tastes, even things I like but didn't think had anything in common with my usual music choices.	1.0 I can't. I'm in Canada. I have used it, though, and I agree, it's excellent.
1.0 I do.	1.0 Me too.
1.0 Why not?	1.0 because everyone loves a cynic.
1.0 Yes, but I'd like to know the significance of the selected subreddits. And I'd like to be able to customize the list.	1.0 They change as you view reddits. They learn which reddits you view most frequently.
1.0 That means that you have frequently read submissions in the reddit.com, obama, and politics subreddits. The subreddits that appear in the top bar are the ones you visit most frequently.	1.0 is that true?
1.0 I quit shoving my fat face.	1.0 Just decided to quit one day, right? I did that once. SOmething just snapped in my head, and I need it to snap again.
1.0 Ha Ha I know how it's used. Yes, I'm 45, female and, miraculously, somehow, not too fat. I wil make you an honourary Australian and call you cobber .	1.0 Wow, that's awesome. Cobber. Well, I'm off to bed. I'll see you around, and thanks for the advice.
1.0 Wonderful. Did you write that in one go?	1.0 Yep. It took about twenty minutes.
1.0 Haha I just drink it out of the blender!	1.0 How fancy. I just grab the ingredients, mix them in the dirt, and eat them by hand.
1.0 Unfortunately, you're out of luck: nobody can help a liberal arts major understand anything.	1.0 They understand how to work the fryer.
1.0 Unfortunately, you're out of luck: nobody can help a liberal arts major understand anything. EOS 1.0 you, sir, must be an engineer! lol EOS 1.0 Actually, his spelling was impeccable.	1.0 Engineers make enough money to hire personal document editors. They no learn to learn no spellings.
1.0 The common situation would be that the father is forced to financially support that child he didn't want to have.	1.0 Also, it doesn't matter what the hell she thinks, the state is there to 'protect' her. Her opinion of his financial liability means nothing as far the law goes.
1.0 Why is it disposing of a mass of tissue when the guy wants it gone but killing his baby if she does?	1.0 the same reason that it is a parasite if the woman doesn't want it bit a cherished member of HER family if she wants it.
1.0 Forcing somebody to do something, perhaps without pay. Sounds like slavery to me.	1.0 Sounds like child support to me.
1.0 A man should have no say in it, but he should also not be responsible for any financial support. Her body, her decision, her bill.	1.0 His penis, coulda kept it in his pants.
1.0 High Intensity Training reduced food intake. Aerobic low intensity exercises will reduce your muscles.	1.0 but don't reduce your protein intake.
1.0 High Intensity Training reduced food intake. Aerobic low intensity exercises will reduce your muscles.	1.0 and regain the weight as soon as you drop the regiment.
1.0 Have your left arm amputated.	1.0 Bad advice. Depending on the OP fattiness, his weight loss will be more than 75 lean weight. A really bad diet will have this percentage at 50 .
1.0 Bang out huge swaths of the the PCT, Appalachian trail or the whole Colorado trail.	1.0 The JMT works pretty well too. Beautiful and only about 220 miles.
1.0 That sounds like a happy medium. I usually hate sweet pickles, but love the jalapeno. Will have to try our saturday market...	1.0 Cracker Barrel sells something similar, but it is not as good
1.0 That sounds like a happy medium. I usually hate sweet pickles, but love the jalapeno. Will have to try our saturday market...	1.0 I don't like sweet pickles much by themselves, but they are great in salads. I put both dill and sweet in salads. It depends on what mood I am in.
1.0 chow chow, it's a little spicy and a little sweet perfect for savory salads.	1.0 chow chow good mmmm
1.0 Is that US ? Just making sure.	1.0 yes...and there is a little wiggle room with budget but not much...
1.0 Doesn't Adobe CS3 cost 500?	1.0 No, it's free, isn't it?
1.0 Doesn't Adobe CS3 cost 500? EOS 1.0 CS3 master suite costs over 1500. I can get it for a fraction of that through school.	1.0 So basically, we're going to assume you already have CS3? I'm just going to be quite vague and say you need a lot of RAM.
1.0 Nope, not gonna do it. EOS 1.0 its 100 possible if i buy the components seperately.	1.0 No, I was declining your demand to help you pick the components, not saying it wasn't possible.
1.0 Consider using an older copy of the Adobe suite I find that CS2 CS3 require a TON more CPU than CS1 did. EOS 1.0 And completely gimp your graphic design career in the process. It's very important to stay on the edge in design.	1.0 Premiere hasn't changed significantly in a decade.
1.0 With hard drive sizes these days you are far better going to scsi, maybe one of those seagate barracudas, than a raid 0 with normal hard drives.	1.0 scsi drives are expensive, how are you going to afford a large enough scsi drive to fit all those big video files, with just a 600 budget?
1.0 Doesn't Adobe CS3 cost 500? EOS 1.0 CS3 master suite costs over 1500. I can get it for a fraction of that through school. EOS 1.0 You mean bittorent? EOS 1.0 if my school didn't offer it so cheap i would likely go that route... EOS 1.0 And how much does your school offer it for? EOS 1.0 for students its 385 for master suite, 250 for design premium	1.0 and how much would you charge me for shipping? lol
1.0 the only computer game i still play is CS 1.6 EOS 1.0 so whatever is good enough for that, etc	1.0 ha...basically what i was getting at is that i don't play many computer games...counterstrike 1.6 runs flawlessly on my 5 year old laptop
1.0 I'd like to be able to see through clothes.	1.0 but i've seen everythin
1.0 heal fly invisibility... is there a name for all those in one?	1.0 god mode
1.0 heal fly invisibility... is there a name for all those in one?	1.0 Peter Petrelli?
1.0 heal fly invisibility... is there a name for all those in one?	1.0 Chuc. . . never mind, fuck it. It's just not funny.
1.0 Read and understand other people's code.	1.0 Heck, I'd like to be able to read and understand my own code.
1.0 Read and understand other people's code.	1.0 That would make you an OpenBSD developer.
1.0 Omniscience, with the precondition that it didn't cause crippling depression.	1.0 The Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?! Oh the things about you! You're better than the frogs bwuahahaahahahahahhaa...
1.0 The ability to fly. I wish I could just fly away sometimes, and just forget about everything down there for a moment. Flying around, just being. I'd be infinitely happy.	1.0 Until you got hit by a plane.
1.0 The ability to fly. I wish I could just fly away sometimes, and just forget about everything down there for a moment. Flying around, just being. I'd be infinitely happy.	1.0 You'd also be very cold.
1.0 I'd like to be able to see through clothes. EOS 1.0 Why not take it one step further?	1.0 Mmmm... sexy bones.
1.0 I'd like to be able to see through clothes. EOS 1.0 Why not take it one step further?	1.0 And that is?
1.0 Would that mean you could lift someone by their water?	1.0 Yup! Totally control everything with water in it. Thus I could fly too by lifting my own water, or by having water shoes.
1.0 The ability to die and then come back to life at will.	1.0 Please don't develop a taste for brains somewhere along the way...
1.0 omnipotence? does that count? well if i were omnipotent i'd make it count. EOS 1.0 Omnipotence would be cool as hell for a few weeks, then be mind numbingly boring for eternity .	1.0 ...which is why CEOs turn to How much can I steal from the company and movie stars self destruct.
1.0 omnipotence? does that count? well if i were omnipotent i'd make it count. EOS 1.0 Omnipotence would be cool as hell for a few weeks, then be mind numbingly boring for eternity . EOS 1.0 but you're omnipotent.. you can make it not boring. EOS 1.0 That's a doozy.	1.0 Well by definition omnipotence allows you to do whatever you wish, with literally no limit, so that would definitely be doable.
1.0 To kill a yak, with mindbullets. EOS 1.0 That's telekinesis, Kyle!	1.0 How bout the power... to move you ?
1.0 The ability to slow down time for everyone except me so that I can move around while everyone is frozen .	1.0 Yes, there was an episode of the New Twilight Zone or something where this happened. I wanted it so badly. Clearly I would use this power solely for nefarious purposes.
1.0 I got the impression that he had metal bits in his costume. That, and impeccable balance.	1.0 Yea really it's like he ignores inertia.
1.0 The ability to slow down time for everyone except me so that I can move around while everyone is frozen . EOS 1.0 speed up time for you or slow it down for them?	1.0 Slow time for them, seems to be more correct, otherwise if time for me goes faster than usual I would also had to have faster perception.
1.0 The ability to fly. I wish I could just fly away sometimes, and just forget about everything down there for a moment. Flying around, just being. I'd be infinitely happy. EOS 1.0 I guess it depends how fast you could fly. What if you could only go as fast as you can walk?	1.0 You can fall pretty fucking fast. So even if it takes a long time to achieve altitude, you could get some pretty sweet gliding action, I'd guess.
1.0 The ability to turn matter into energy, store it in my body, and turn it back into matter at will. EOS 1.0 I do that once a day.	1.0 3 times a day for me.
1.0 Haruhi Suzumiya style. EOS 1.0 So the rest of humanity would have to battle your inner demons, literally?	1.0 Yeah, :3.
1.0 The ability to upmod a comment a thousand times. EOS 1.0 If wacrover was God and this was a genuine question, you would be so sorry.	1.0 Good point. I'd upmod you a thousand times but ya' know.
1.0 I want the ability to have more than one ability. EOS 1.0 In school, I fucking hated kids like you.	1.0 i still hate kids like him.
1.0 Haruhi Suzumiya style. EOS 1.0 I just discovered a very cool anime to watch. Thank you.	1.0 Read the novels, too. They're awesome as well.
1.0 I'd be a god. The Christian God, Allah, or Yahweh to be specific. That way I'd be all powerful.	1.0 But you wouldn't exist.
1.0 why not just make it after you go through security? EOS 1.0 Also, the ability to make other people get nonsensical humor.	1.0 ah. now I understand.
1.0 Yeah I'm pretty sure they are actually friends. I know because Fox News made a huge deal out of it and tried to frame Paul as a truther. EOS 1.0 Really? Hmm... I was always a bit skeptical of Alex Jones, like he might be a fraud. Having Ron Paul on his show kind of validates him to me. EOS 1.0 Alex Jones is an idiot. The fact that Ron Paul goes on his show reflects badly on Ron Paul. EOS 1.0 Is he? What makes you think so?	1.0 He believes in conspiracy theories.
1.0 The solution to this is simple. Tell your dad McCain won. He obviously doesn't really know what's going on considering his point of view. EOS 1.0 Just tell him he voted for McCain? The fact that Obama won shouldn't be the son's fault.. Edit: Or daughter's, sorry. EOS 1.0 Or hermaphrodite's. EOS 1.0 Or toaster's. EOS 1.0 You asshole, my uncle was a Cylon.	1.0 Cylons are from India?
1.0 Didn't you post this a while back? EOS 1.0 yeah...this sounds really familiar to me	1.0 I think so... I don't remember.
1.0 I say Bless you because of the rude factor. I also say, Need a tissue? That gets me out of the God realm and into the paper product distribution category.	1.0 Oh Dwight, such a salesman.
1.0 Saying bless you after a sneeze is about as religious as Santa Claus and Christmas these days.	1.0 You take that back! Santa died for your sins on that tree!
1.0 I don't say anything. Why am I required to say something when someone sneezes?	1.0 You're not required, though it's a big customary action. I do it because saying gesundheit reminds people that I'm aware they exist and that I care about their health.
1.0 I say Awesometown . Don't know why, but that is the password to my account too!	1.0 what do you say? it came as on my screen?
1.0 Mine are still right where I left them.	1.0 How do you access them? I have this problem too.
1.0 Well, right now I'm considering finding and murdering you for your subject verb title disagreement.	1.0 Fuck. I thought I deleted this one.
1.0 I don't do questionably legal things. I go whole hog.	1.0 OK, you take the snout, tail and feet. ...i'll take all the Bacon!
1.0 Seems like self selection bias in who is willing to answer is going to make this rather less interesting.	1.0 you're stoned outta your gourd, aren't you?
1.0 I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.	1.0 I'm starting small, with kittens. I'll work my way up to Renoans by the end of the year.
1.0 I claimed to own land in Canada that I don't and then sold it to my friend for a Twix bar... Sorry, make that TWO Twix bars. EOS 1.0 Two for you, none for him. EOS 1.0 Yeah and now he's living up in a log cabin in Canada, has NO IDEA he's not supposed to be there. EOS 1.0 Are you serious? EOS 1.0 It's about half and half. I'm pretty sure he knew I didn't actually own any land in Canada and just bought me a candy bar to be nice. EOS 1.0 I think if you live on land for a certain amount of time, you can actually claim it.	1.0 There's an idea.... I have been craving a reese's cup lately...
1.0 I just say... nice.	1.0 Damn straight!
1.0 Try bombastic or that is the bee's knees. I use them sometimes to make things more interesting. EOS 1.0 Why would you use bombastic? It means sort of up yourself, pretentious.	1.0 Sort of a mix between da bomb and fantastic. Words can have more than one meaning but I admit I made this shit up off the top of my head.
1.0 Dope wicked the bees knees that was fresh	1.0 I think we used to hang out.
1.0 use balls deep	1.0 B DAP 'Balls deep anal penetration'
1.0 The cat's pajamas.	1.0 Yeah, I've used cat's pajamas to good effect and it goes well paired with the bee's knees .
1.0 The cat's pajamas.	1.0 The dog's bollocks
1.0 I adopted 'Right on sometime ago, my vocabulary has suffered substantially. EOS 1.0 At least you didn't start saying Dandy! mysteriously two months ago. How are you? Dandy! EOS 1.0 Oh, that's just swell! Good for you!	1.0 Gee golly gosh, mister, you have a gay old time now!
1.0 awesome post is awesome EOS 1.0 Stupid comment is not. EOS 1.0 Is not stupid?	1.0 So, Stupid comment is awesome? Sweet!
1.0 cool beans EOS 1.0 I want to punch people who say that in the face. EOS 1.0 cool beans	1.0 Thanks a lot, now I'm angry and I have no one to punch.
1.0 Far out EOS 1.0 I've been trying to bring outta sight back.	1.0 Nice! I'll join that cause...
1.0 The tits.	1.0 Dude, that's totally tits.
1.0 galactic is good.	1.0 I'm partial to Cyclopean , I think. Wow, your new girlfriend is so Cyclopean!
1.0 Say girlicious. Then punch yourself in the head.	1.0 i did it, actually. in retrospect, i'd rather not have a headache.
1.0 What happens if you don't drink and just pull an all nighter once in a while? EOS 1.0 I don't know, haven't tried it. I was thinking about that, maybe just stay up until I have no choice but to fall asleep. Thanks for the idea.	1.0 Go for it. Try to get used to being dead tired when it's time to go to sleep, and hopefully it will start feeling less natural to consume various things.
1.0 An hero. EOS 1.0 An Rand.	1.0 An ions.
1.0 They used to give people acid in the 50's in psyc wards to cure alcoholism. It worked 1 2 to 2 3 of the time I think.	1.0 I just used it a few months ago. Didn't work.
1.0 For what games?	1.0 The only game I play in OSX on my Macbook Pro is WoW. The icepack method helps a ton if it starts getting hot and chuggy.
1.0 Don't. Join the Air force instead. EOS 1.0 Isn't the Air Force part of the military?	1.0 I have no idea. I would no join any of them.
1.0 Me too..keeps doing it..refreshing fixes it usually...i thought maybe it was just me and ignored it...	1.0 Me too and refreshing fixes it.
1.0 Me too..keeps doing it..refreshing fixes it usually...i thought maybe it was just me and ignored it...	1.0 Me too, but refreshing does not fix it. I usually just have to go back to work.
1.0 Me too.... after a few tries it continues on but WTF is going on EOS 1.0 Welcome to reddit. Please use what works on reddit until latest major bug is fixed. Just ignore the little bugs. Those will never be fixed.	1.0 like sorting comments...god damn it.
1.0 I keep getting There doesn't seem to be anything here. Now go outside and play you fat fuck. Is it just me? EOS 1.0 Mine says, There doesn't seem to be anything here. Now go have sex with your hot wife.	1.0 So where the hell are you going to find a hot wife?
1.0 I keep getting There doesn't seem to be anything here. Now go outside and play you fat fuck. Is it just me? EOS 1.0 Mine says, There doesn't seem to be anything here. Now go have sex with your hot wife.	1.0 Hey, mine says Now go and have sex with jakedfw's hot wife too!
1.0 This is how reddit works. You must be new. Get used to it. Ctrl F is your friend.	1.0 Apparently you've never visited the new page or anything after the next button

1.0 That's a scary thought. Please be wrong.	1.0 High frequencies are much more damaging than low frequencies. It's why every drummer asks hah? all the time the cymbals have fried their ears.

Quite aside from the philosophical issues of 'nothing' being something, I got bored after a while and ended up on Reddit.	1.0 I kinda meant like not putting any real effort into anything... just sorta coasting along...

1.0 No, you're bigoted because you choose to needlessly denigrate those who you view as being less rational than you.	1.0 Ah, here's the problem: You cannot tell the difference between a person and an idea. They are NOT the same thing.
1.0 That sounds like something I would say. EOS 1.0 That could be because the entire human race is one human that keeps on getting reincarnated over and over and over.	1.0 And that's silly. If you are trying to make some sort of point, you aren't.

1.0 Isn't grooming another primate a sign of affection? This guy would have been everyone's best friend back in the early days of our evolution. EOS 1.0 What does that mean? Evolution? You mean Jesus? EOS 1.0 Jesus was a primate too. He needed friends like our poster here to keep his beard clean. EOS 1.0 I think by that time common courtesy had evolved from parasite picking to feet washing. EOS 1.0 And today, we groom eachother by correcting grammar and word usage in their posts. Isn't that right, tylerdmace?	1.0 ...And then we get abused and called grammar nazi.

1.0 Nothing, and I mean nothing, is faster to get a drug into your system then inhaled through the lungs. Faster than mainlining heroin.	1.0 What about intravenous injections?
1.0 One Word: Inhalants. EOS 1.0 Yeah, why not make inhalers or patches or syrups or other forms to get it into the bloodstream without adding carcinogens from the smoke?	1.0 Vaporizers are the answer. All the goods with none of the smoke.
1.0 After seeing that, I always feel sorry for the man.	1.0 And I feel like he is completely bonkers.
1.0 Not bad. But you failed at humility.	1.0 He also failed at failing.

1.0 It's upside down	1.0 That is so rocking my world right now.
1.0 this is the at least the third time this thread has happened. EOS 1.0 Is there something wrong with that? This gives the newcomers a chance to tell their stories.	1.0 no, not complaining. i just thought it was an interesting fact worth mentioning.
1.0 Why's everybody so fancy with their signatures? I've never understood it myself all I do is write my name in print. Then again, I never like Cursive.	1.0 It's supposed to be harder for someone to forge if it's a bit fancy. It's easier to copy printing and make it look convincing.
1.0 there doesn't seem to be anything here	1.0 That's what she said.
1.0 I'm so glad that you're getting out there and challenging yourself! And also thank you for updating I often wonder what becomes of people who ask reddit.	1.0 Not much, in my case. Worse off by a quantitative analysis. Qualitatively I just don't give a shit, but that's about as Keynesian as I'm going to get today.
1.0 It took me a few minutes to sort out what I was going to add in my comment. See below.	1.0 But that was funny.
1.0 You do realize that you have nothing to lose, right? EOS 1.0 He could be falsely accused of rape.	1.0 pn6, there's such thing as going too far, and just making you and, by association, the ideas you support look bad.

1.0 What in the hell are you talking about?	1.0 the animal called homo sapien sapien
1.0 You have turned social situations into a series of tasks and strategies!	1.0 That's what they are anyways. It's just more intuitive for some people than for others.
1.0 How are you physically? Going to the gym once or twice a week does wonders for self esteem.	1.0 Amen! I get horny right after, staring down the suburban moms in their skimpy tennis getups, even if they aren't super attractive.
1.0 Thank you for your support, CuntSmellersINC.	1.0 I just stumbled in here, but I fully support your attempts to quantitatively experiment with the art of social finagling.
1.0 I really hope you aren't a flight instructor.	1.0 Nope. Commercial airline pilot.
1.0 Some geek did this experiment before you. Read Neil Strauss: The Game It will open your eyes. EOS 1.0 I think the OP is more interested in meeting women than manipulating fleshy robots into spreading their legs for him by manipulating their psyche.	1.0 Well, have you read the book?
1.0 I was gonna use my alternate account. For name troll effect. I forgot. Durrrr me. EOS 1.0 I think if you left it no one would've been the wiser, now we know you have an alternate account with a related name. EOS 1.0 I know your secret reddit identity!	1.0 Let's hear it.
1.0 If you are a designer, don't even think about it. Windows. EOS 1.0 That's not what you see in most reputable design schools.	1.0 That's because they use Mac, but Resilience already said they aren't an option. Windows is second place.
1.0 Plug it in. Turn it on. That solves most problems.	1.0 That causes most problems, actually..
1.0 I don't trust search engines, so I check the whole web by hand, one page at a time.	1.0 I outsource this part of my searching abroad.
1.0 I see in the tv and in the park that people with big musscles kiss them alot. Is that a seacret way to make them bigger? Like talking to plants?	1.0 I heard when you kiss your own penis it makes it huge as well.
1.0 I see in the tv and in the park that people with big musscles kiss them alot. Is that a seacret way to make them bigger? Like talking to plants? EOS 1.0 I know for certain that theres one muscle in my body that grows bigger and harder when someone kisses it.	1.0 so it does work?

1.0 My own On accident I swear EOS 1.0 Beat me to the joke. EOS 1.0 You know when your Mom said that if you do that, you'll go blind....that's what she meant. Or, she might have said, Put that away...you'll put your eye out!	1.0 That's not what your Mom said to me ...
1.0 I love cumming on women's faces, and I have many times. Obviously only with their permission. A lot of women actually like it.	1.0 Oh, and I totally have a girlfriend. She's totally real, too.
1.0 What about using the fucking sex subreddit?	1.0 bit redundant, don't you think?
1.0 What about using the fucking sex subreddit?	1.0 stebby baby, askreddit seemed appropriate... I mean... ask... reddit dig
1.0 My ex girlfriend liked to try things she saw in pornos. It was nice. EOS 1.0 I'd bet money that the reasons why she's your ex girlfriend, and was great in bed are identical: she's crazy. EOS 1.0 She was bat shit crazy. Liked to throw things at me.	1.0 Well to be fair, you threw jizz at her.
1.0 On and in. In feels better. EOS 1.0 you've ejaculated IN someone's face?!? The mechanics behind that are scary indeed my friend.	1.0 In the mouth.
1.0 I think it's more of a turn on to cum inside them. EOS 1.0 Agreed, when she blows me I have no desire to pull out or to work it myself. EOS 1.0 I meant during intercourse, not during a blow job.	1.0 OK, I'm for inside in both cases.
1.0 yes. Got in her hair. She was pissed.	1.0 It's apparently genuinely annoying to have cum in your hair. I once saw my gf tried to wash it out, and it's somewhat difficult.
1.0 Well, I work at a hospital, patients are walking around with their kids and boobies are probably not the best thing for them to see on my monitor.	1.0 maybe seeing someone in health care giving a shit and actually doing their job might be a better sight to see for everyone concerned
1.0 I thought work was the best time to view NSFW.	1.0 Yep, it's all 'bout the trill.
1.0 thank you.	1.0 Have you tried the save button? You can use it to view questionable stuff when you're not at work.
1.0 How about don't reddit when you're on the clock, you thieving bastard EOS 1.0 how about I work 3rd shift and there's absolutely nothing else to do.	1.0 Have you finished those TPS reports yet? I thought not.

EOS 1.0 check compress link display in your prefs. problem solved.	1.0 Oh, man . Thank you a thousand times over. I don't have any problem with pornographic content, but I hated those damned thumbnails.
1.0 It would help if the thumbnails wouldn't pop up on the general Reddit page too... EOS 1.0 go to your prefs. compress link display.	1.0 No, I want thumbnails, I just don't want NSFW thumbnails unless I'm on the NSFW page.
1.0 Well, I work at a hospital, patients are walking around with their kids and boobies are probably not the best thing for them to see on my monitor. EOS 1.0 this site woudnt be what it is without its sometimes edgy content. If you're unable to view reddit at your workplace, you should find a different site to goof off. EOS 1.0 But we're not against its edgy content I view it once I get home. All we ask is if it's nudey edgy, let us know before we click. EOS 1.0 The submitter has requested something much broader: no breasts in several subreddits. I'm all for tagging the titles out of courtesy, but banning the content is unreasonable.	1.0 Yeah I agree. I'm for tagging, not banning.

Your local mormon chapter?
1.0 Nah, it's been that way since they made the subreddit tag smaller.	1.0 I think you misinterpreted my comment as referring to the NSFW subreddit I have edited it for clarity.
1.0 As someone who works on a computer at work, but cannot access Reddit, I must say Screw you all .	1.0 As someone who controls the Internet at work, and who circumvents his own controls in order to view Reddit I must say HAHA.
1.0 As someone who works on a computer at work, but cannot access Reddit, I must say Screw you all .	1.0 I'm pretty sure that if your job description is as indicated by your nickname, that you're probably not quite so worried about such content at your place of employment.
1.0 I might just be a moron, but I really didn't understand what you're trying to say here... your post could really support people on both sides of this issue.	1.0 He's saying that if you're in the UK, topless content isn't considered such a terrible thing.
1.0 you should charge for those.	1.0 Why are people attacking you? The moral on Reddit has been low lately. I thought your request was valid.
1.0 where did you find a 5 minute version? I only saw the gif.	1.0 ...These two comments above belong in the wtf subreddit. WTF.

1.0 Please stop posting boobie pics... Wut!? No, screw you!	1.0 Keep reading...the rest isn't as scary.
1.0 Because, as was proved on The Office, nobody actually works every damn second of their time at the office. EOS 1.0 My mom does. She has high blood pressure. EOS 1.0 Is that the cause or the effect of working every damn second?	1.0 Whoa, man. Whoa.

1.0 Try just holding up a sign saying Love thy neighbor as thyself or similar. Don't give in to hate. Rise above it.	1.0 I have to admit I like this idea. I think I'll be doing this. Anyone have some favorite quotes? I like bigbradwolfs, any other ideas?
1.0 God hates bigots who hate fags	1.0 Jesus loves the little children, all the little children of the world.
1.0 Hot cider for them is a brilliant idea. I wonder how many would accept it, though. EOS 1.0 Everyone loves a hot Dickens' Cider. EOS 1.0 Too bad they can't serve Dickens' Cidem... Are there any other foods they could serve that would play off this though? Like serve bananas and doughnuts? Fresh tossed salad? EOS 1.0 Bagels and Slim Jims. Twinkies. Santorum on Ritz crackers.

1.0 Do you have two left feet or something that gets you out of selective service?	1.0 Im leaving for Navy bootcamp in March. I dont really care either way about women being included in the draft.

1.0 Umm, I think it was a post on digg.	1.0 I wasn't brought to Reddit so much as systematically nauseated by Digg

1.0 An argument over the moral aspects of circumcision. Over the course of my 1 year reddit career, I have had the same argument 4 times. EOS 1.0 Have your arguments evolved over this time, or do you just say the same thing every time?	1.0 They were not disproved the first time, and they have not been disproved today. They are still the same.

1.0 No shout outs for Graffiti?	1.0 I'm using graffiti simply because of the google tag in the lower right corner.
1.0 I didn't realize asking off topic questions counted as an arrestable offense these days.	1.0 It doesn't. It counted as a reason to ask him to leave, which he refused to do. Trespassing on private property and refusing to leave counts as an arrestable offense.
1.0 Why? Don't you have anything better to do? EOS 1.0 you say on reddit at 3 in the afternoon central time EOS 1.0 good call.	1.0 To be fair though, I didn't really have anything better to do.

1.0 How do they determine your intelligence? EOS 1.0 Most likely IQ tests or simply SAT ACT test scores, probably depends on who you go through.	1.0 Shit if I knew my SAT scores would determine the value of my sperm I would've tried harder.

1.0 Wrong question. The right question is: Given tattoos' permanency and individuality, why are most tattoos so bad and unoriginal if not stereotypical?	1.0 Except that's not the right question because the answer is clear: most people either mistakenly think they are original or see being unoriginal as a plus, not a minus.
1.0 No. It's means you were another Chinese symbol getting bandwagon douche.	1.0 We're clearly in different tribes.

1.0 Remember Sammy Jenkis.	1.0 Don't answer the phone.

1.0 Cutesy fucking posts like these are the reddit equivalent of the I will go slightly out of my way to step on that crunchy looking leaf Facebook groups. Just stop. EOS 1.0 Oh c'mon.

1.0 Sorry, but I just feel that people use AskReddit instead doing any kind of research on their own...	1.0 Personal anecdotes and a knowledge pool like Reddit's is often far superior to a google search.
1.0 Sorry, but I just feel that people use AskReddit instead doing any kind of research on their own... EOS 1.0 So, if you were in a room with a highly passionate expert on x topic and a computer in the corner, you would ignore the expert and Google it?	1.0 I don't know. Google it.
1.0 Apparently I'm an ENTJ but I feel like I'm an INFP.	1.0 I am an ENTJ too. Evidently, we are only 2 of the population. I think this means that we get to run Reddit.

Independence has more meth labs per capita than people.	1.0 I'm sure that's the first sentence in their Lonely Planet entry. It's probably the only sentence in their Lonely Planet entry...

1.0 1. Use a drill to drill through the cap 2. Pour into cup 3. Profit	1.0 With bonus metal shavings amp paint chips!
1.0 I get an elastic band and wrap it around the cap. The big thick ones that are used to tie broccoli together are the best.	1.0 That's a pretty good idea. We have a rubber pad in our utensil drawer that usually does the same thing.
1.0 it sounded really good when I was stoned	1.0 Haha what doesn't?

1.0 That's partly due to Reddit's mechanism if you don't downmod things that bore you, you'll keep seeing topics that bore you. EOS 1.0 Are you suggesting that Reddit knows what i like and don't, and then tailors my experience to that? Or that downmodding stuff will hopefully make people stop submitting it?	1.0 Both, supposedly.
1.0 I've never downmodded a link in my life. I know, crucify me.	1.0 Same, if it sucks, well then it sucks, and if people want to see something that sucks, well, they might suck.
1.0 incorrect pluralization in the headline might do it EOS 1.0 Any pluralization related problem? Do you have any example's of this?	1.0 I'm just pulling your chain. Criterion is singular, criteria is plural. What are your criteria...

1.0 Buy barrels of crude for 50 per barrel and wait two years. EOS 1.0 you mean 4 or 8 years, when a Republican takes Office again.	1.0 If you really think that having a democrat in office will keep prices of oil lower, you're far more ignorant than I'd have hoped for a redditor.
1.0 I would buy 500,000 white t shirts and 500,000 pairs of clean white socks. One less thing to worry about in life I figure. EOS 1.0 Where the heck are you going to find white tshirts and socks for a dollar?	1.0 Is that expensive or cheap?
1.0 You will die a quick and painless death. Lucky Numbers: 1, 6, 10. EOS 1.0 In bed.	1.0 Specifically, your mom's bed.

1.0 It would probably be better if you went to Yahoo! Answers	1.0 Replace better with hilarious.
1.0 Is drinking from another's glass sexual? No. Therefore, whatever disease is contracted via drinking from another's glass is not a S exually T ransmitted D isease.	1.0 With that logic, that would be like saying 'AIDS' isn't an 'STD' if you got it from sharing needles.
1.0 Is drinking from another's glass sexual? No. Therefore, whatever disease is contracted via drinking from another's glass is not a S exually T ransmitted D isease.	1.0 Sorry, science is stronger than semantics.

1.0 D.C. sure as hell could use some investment in public transportation. Shit sucks ass, even if it is clean as hell.	1.0 Baltimore too. The roads are horrible to drive on and I've waited for more than an hour to catch a bus that should be coming every 20 minutes or so.
1.0 Because they don't invest in a multimillion dollar train system that would stop the train every 3 blocks for people to exit and enter? Haha.	1.0 I meant buses. Sorry for not clarifying.
1.0 Knowing what Biden is and the sorts of things he votes for, I hope that he never has any influence on Obama.	1.0 The only time I considered not voting for Obama was when he picked Biden, actually.
1.0 Yeah, probably the lamest portion of the service. But you can pack your queue as long as you'd like and scroll through it. EOS 1.0 So how do you watch the HD ones? They're not on the website.	1.0 You can't chose them. The Netflix service tests your download speed and choses a video quality that it thinks is suitable for your connection.
1.0 Depends on your location, mid west rules for gas.	1.0 Yep. 1.61 here.
1.0 Cowon players are nice	1.0 Are there any with a hard drive bigger than 80GB?

EOS 1.0 What the hell's a cartoon? EOS 1.0 It's a fancy word for the box that milk comes in.	1.0 Then I like the ones with the missin' kids! Heh heh heh! Losers.
1.0 Practice speaking with a metronome, each syllable a beat.	1.0 I've heard that people who stutter don't have less problems when singing, perhaps the beat has something to do with it.
1.0 You could just kick back and relax and say screw it?	1.0 I can personally attest to this plan.
1.0 just a good old tug once in a while to raise the heart rate and add definition. EOS 1.0 Make sure to change hands once in a while. My left forearm was nearly double the size of my right one.

1.0 Get the program and draw some lines, play with the shapes and airbrushes, that would help a lot!	1.0 Yeah, I have been messing around with it, but it can be a little frustrating and unintuitive, when you want to do something specific, but you don't know how.
1.0 because I dont take vicodin unless I am in REAL pain. And I dont use drugs recreationally. Hell, I rarely take aspirin. EOS 1.0 So why does that mean you won't fail a drug test? Maybe you took one a few hours before you got in the car. Test failed.	1.0 its quite rare that I have to take them. Last time was over a year ago.
1.0 That sucks. I was thinking of doing marijuana, too but I'm limited on time. EOS 1.0 Yeah, time wasn't an issue just respectable credible sources. I was going to do it on things like who ever brings the weed gets to puff first, etc. EOS 1.0 lol. i need a puff...as well as a joint EOS 1.0 Ha, I haven't smoked in years. well marijuana that is. EOS 1.0 I only smoke like 2 or 3 times a year during breaks in the semester.	1.0 That's probably a good thing, I just got to the point where smoking was getting me to analytical.

1.0 Thinking about my cute little 1 year old!	1.0 I'm not sure that advice works for others. It might even get them arrested!
1.0 Any job that is hard to get up for is not worth doing. Stop reading the web, start reading books. EOS 1.0 Really? Every job has it's bad days, and some people just aren't morning people. EOS 1.0 I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he's not complaining about one day or that he's a lazy ass.	1.0 Oh. Yeah, nevermind. I see what's up.

1.0 So your answer to laziness is to make a fool of yourself in public? EOS 1.0 This method helped me write and publish two books, create three start ups, and illustrate 13 children's books. If you're unable to get motivated by public failure then you're fairly hopeless.	1.0 Look, I'm a dismal failure. I don't dispute it. You may not be, but this method probably didn't help you much either. You're probably a smart capable person.
1.0 seek treatment for depression dysthimia. eat st. john wort or 5HTP pills. do aerobic exercise. eat caffeine pills in the morning. install pageaddict for firefox. EOS 1.0 St. John's Wort gave me the worst stomach ache I've ever had, I had to lay off that stuff right after taking it.	1.0 try 5HTP. also, try it again. it could be related to something else you ate.

Reality just doesn't work like that.	1.0 Yeah, all those near c travelers are making a mockery of the system of law. Also the watch industry.

1.0 I hope an asteroid hits earth and kills everyone and everything in it the day after I die. Yea I'm an asshole.	1.0 Don't kill me off man, I'm not so bad.
1.0 Only if I could travel the galaxy delivering packages and fall in love with a one eyed mutant.	1.0 Sounds like a good idea for a show, have you pitched that anywhere?
1.0 Obviously the whole point of civilization is to go as fast as possible.	1.0 So you go as fast as possible. If that's c, fine by me.
1.0 There's always cryonics. The worst that can happen is you wake up. EOS 1.0 Last I checked they had no way of waking people up. So essentially you're killing yourself by getting frozen.	1.0 You have to be dead before they can legally freeze you.
1.0 I think you would be squished by the centrifugal effect.	1.0 Only on Reddit would someone make the point of using centrifugal effect instead of centrifugal force. Thank you.
1.0 Probably recognizable, but understandable? Thik about what english sounded like 500 years ago. I doubt you would be able to communicate with anyone 500 years from now!	1.0 Yeah, but with modern recording, writing, and communications, language is more fixed. People want to watch old movies and read old books, after all.
1.0 If I could be a brain with a dick, hooked up to redtube I'd be in heaven.	1.0 ... I think you're missing something.
1.0 I'm kind of scared of Morlocks...	1.0 Exactly. No future for me.

1.0 I would've gone to medical school. Seven years of education and a hell of a lot of debt would be well worth it.	1.0 Same idea, but architecture for me.
1.0 Congratulations! You got the joke!	1.0 Hooray! Where's my party hat?
1.0 That's between her and him. Mind your own fucking business.	1.0 They both talked to me about it because I thought the same. I'd love to mind my own fucking business but he keeps asking for advice. tl dr Go fuck yourself.
1.0 Not sure. My houseboy handles details like that.	1.0 The last time the house boy handled my details I almost got arrested.
1.0 Well, would you be able to live? Does gravitational force increase as it descends towards the center? Would the force coming at you from both side crush you, or anything?	1.0 you got me there...

1.0 If you have a graduate degree, shouldn't you be applying for jobs that require a resume rather than an application?	1.0 Not in this economy..
1.0 Tell them you murdered someone. Then when they get upset, say just kidding its really just shoplifting and they will be all relieved and hire you.	1.0 door in the face technique, i like it
1.0 We're all equally stupid and doomed.	1.0 Sounds like a Roland Emmerich movie. Where can I download it?
1.0 Nope we're the same species we've been for millions of years.	1.0 That's not true. Gene frequencies change over time and culture plays a significant role in the way we think and act.
1.0 No I think we're much dumber. Hell, we can even work out where apostrophes are needed.	1.0 Before an s at the end of a word. Consider it a dialect change, you can't fight it.

1.0 Definitely gets better, but you're right, it did start a bit flat. EOS 1.0 Six Feet Under is was my favorite show ever, but I watched the first episode of True Blood and hated it. I guess I'll have to give it another chance...	1.0 It's gotten very interesting where the plot is now, I say give it another go.
1.0 The Wire EOS 1.0 Seconded. BEST SHOW EVER.	1.0 I've just started it. I'm blown away. Fans of The Sopranos Deadwood Six Feet Under: will these disappoint after The Wire? Or will they hold their own?
1.0 I've heard a few people say this, which is understandable. The show is definitely slow paced, but once the story lines develop, it's a good slow burn.	1.0 Ha, I've heard that too, not sure I can tolerate it though. Good to know you enjoy it though.
1.0 Burn Notice. Great show about a spy who tries to figure out who in the US Gov. outed him. EOS 1.0 a good show, yes. good for the same reasons as six feet under? absolutely not.	1.0 True true.

1.0 If you need more than coffee, maybe the answer is more sleep. edit: As I have my second espresso after 2 cups of coffee. EOS 1.0 If you are looking to reduce the caffeine intake drink more of the espresso and less of the coffee. EOS 1.0 Its lower caffeine is a big bonus for me in the afternoon. I usually do coffee in the morning and espresso in the afternoon.	1.0 I'm not a big fan of it, I usually do tea lately since my stomach can't do coffee... but i'm cheating right now.
1.0 I started a biz because I didn't like the 9 to 5. Managed to make the same money but with 8 months off each year.	1.0 yea i don't like Dolly Parton either.

1.0 When I was 9 I opened up a black jack casino at recess. Got shut down pretty quickly. EOS 1.0 I ran a tamagotchi daycare center in elementry school, also used to run in Warhead candy after it was banned.	1.0 Someone banned Warheads? Those godless fucks.
1.0 couldn't agree more. I'd also like to see a comment karma comment ratio.	1.0 I'd like to see my comment sorting put back.
1.0 I occasionally check others' comment karma to see if they're just trolls. Also, spammers tend to have low comment karma and much higher submitted karma.	1.0 Exactly, it's a good way to determine if someone is worth responding too, though that's not always true.
1.0 i put it on my resume...dont you? EOS 1.0 pffft, amateur. I have mine tatooed on my forehead. EOS 1.0 How do you handle updates? I am intrigued.	1.0 Small font and strike throughs. I've got enough real estate to work with for a few more months, then I'm going to have to switch to my cheeks.

1.0 because of the word Toss in it?	1.0 Many Americans wouldn't make the connection.
1.0 I think it started in prison. So much of what's present in pop culture came from prison. That doesn't really explain the origins though. Wiki? EOS 1.0 what else in pop culture came from prison? EOS 1.0 Plenty of fashion, slang and music has been influenced by prison culture. EOS 1.0 ie, make someone your bitch	1.0 I thought that was from kindergarten. Maybe my school was tougher than I thought...
1.0 I thought it was because inmates weren't allowed to have belts for fear of them strangling someone.	1.0 Elastic waistbands.
1.0 Law enforcement...	1.0 Actually, a lot of police departments currently have hiring freezes from a lack of funding.
1.0 Green jobs maybe?	1.0 Does growing weed count?
1.0 Not devs. When recession hits, companies just maintain rather than develop new software. And the maintain guys are the blokes that have been there for 20 years, not new blood.	1.0 Yeah that was my thought. Although there are plenty of people maintaining with out 20 years of experience.
1.0 An article in USA Today said cobblers are all the rage now.	1.0 Even the republics are all the rage now. For the wrong reasons
1.0 Repo Man. You're gonna be flooded with business for years to come. EOS 1.0 Rape O'man. You're gonna be flooded with business for years to come.	1.0 King of Oman. You're gonna be flooded with oil for years to come.

1.0 Two chicks at the same time	1.0 Not all of us were born with two dicks at the same time, reincarnation notwithstanding.
1.0 but why save if youre never going to spend it?	1.0 Retire early. Or retire on time more comfortably than otherwise.
1.0 Yes. Take a look at Japan.	1.0 Japan only has the savings rate they do now after living through the Japanese banking crisis of the '90s.
1.0 You should stop over in Hong Kong if you're doing SE Asia. You won't regret it.	1.0 That's actually looking very likely, although I'll probably save it for the end of my trip after Beijing. HK would be a nice place to fly home from.
1.0 Head to Vietnam where that 5 months worth of money can keep me comfortable for 10 years. EOS 1.0 Convert 1 10th of it into zimbabwe money, so you can be a pentillionaire.	1.0 Sorry, they already cut off a dozen zeroes.
1.0 You missed 'banks could fail and all savings could be lost'.	1.0 Or we could get hyperinflation and the dollars become worthless... that is if you are foolish enough to trust your savings to dollars
1.0 It does suck, all those years and it sounds like it was put together in a matter of weeks.	1.0 It probably was. There was probably no real incentive for them to put it together until Dr. Pepper gave them one.

1.0 I did.	1.0 Take the challenge seriously, ok? It's not easy for you. Use this as a lesson and get on with the job. You can do it. Let her help you.
1.0 I don't have a GF to be mad at me you lucky bastard. EOS 1.0 I can be mad at you if you want, you drunk fuck... EOS 1.0 you guys kill me.	1.0 Erm, okay. kills you See what your drinking does?!

1.0 RAM is cheap nowadays ... EOS 1.0 I think he's looking for a more permanent solution. Solid state, ftw. EOS 1.0 RAM is solid state. A HDD is not.

EOS 1.0 Solid state drives usually are just clusters of flash memory.	1.0 That's where I made the mistake, if I had said, Ram require continuous power, while flash memory devices do not , would I have been correct?
1.0 Excuse me if I infer that you haven't showered in over a week and a half.	1.0 That's where the flavor comes from. Saying he bought a new shower curtain rod doesn't mean there isn't one there already.
1.0 Magnesium deficiency can affect memory. Try supplements. EOS 1.0 Vitamin B as well.	1.0 B12 specifically is important from what I hear. especially if you're vegetarian vegan

1.0 You can't hide a tramcar in your underpants that's what my father always says. EOS 1.0 Yeah, but they have no use for underpants, how could they? By definition the shrimp content is too emotional.	1.0 That's right, they always blame the Republicans.
1.0 I would prefer if people were forced to comment in order to vote	1.0 Yep I prefer your proposal.
1.0 I lost a friend because I tried being roomates with him. I recommend getting out sooner rather than later and keeping your friend.	1.0 Yeah, that's what I'm figuring out. Unfortunately I'm stuck here for another nine months of the lease.

1.0 I know this probably isn't helpful, but maybe you could play the tape while you pretend to play instruments and sing.	1.0 That was actually strongly considered.
1.0 I will rampantly domnmod stupid submissions.	1.0 Dude... Just unsubscribe from askreddit ... There are no stupid submissions here it's like a chat feature... Just ignore the ones that don't appeal to you. It's that simple.
1.0 I own a boat. EOS 1.0 Why am I being downvoted? It's a legitimate strategy. Zombies can't swim, and I can live off fish for a very long time.	1.0 I downmodded your first comment, but I upmodded the one asking why you were downmodded because that is how you win at Reddit.
1.0 You would enjoy herpes?!	1.0 Correction, his zombiefied FlyingUndeadSheep would have the herpes.

1.0 Radiohead Animal Collective Wilco The Beatles Iron and Wine Decemberists The Arcade Fire Belle and Sebastian EOS 1.0 I know they're incredible, but Animal Collective definitely takes some time and a mature ear to get used to I can't really imagine it as casual office listening.	1.0 I was going to say the same thing. Radiohead might be a little much for the office as well. Wilco is just good frigging music!

If it's only a few, can't you just put it on the ground and stomp in it? EOS 1.0 That gets messy, tears up shoes. Maybe 24 cans a week? Dunno, haven't counted.	1.0 Ok, just curious.
1.0 u talk like a fag n ur shits all retarded ...and i love you.	1.0 despite his logical explanation, he sounded pompous and faggy, so instead he convinced the redditors that he could talk to internets and that they were asking him for revolutions.
1.0 I think you may mean reactive not reactionary ?	1.0 Good point, fixed.
1.0 It is a union of consumers and producers, the rise of the prosumer. This is the dawn of a new economic system, a new political machine, a new civilization.	1.0 Global consciousness is achievable.
1.0 No. I think you have temper issues. Why would you want to kill somebody just for their lack of driving skills? You should see a psychiatrist.	1.0 Trolling: The internet version of tailgating.
1.0 All tailgating proves is that you are willing to risk the lives of the people around you because the extra 5 10 seconds you'll save are more important. Please DIAF.	1.0 Way to concede the high ground.
1.0 You don't happen to own that liquor store down on the corner or anything, do you?	1.0 No, but I wish I owned a bar near you, so I could accommodate your research.

1.0 meet both ways and meet both way make no sense to me, meet half way does.	1.0 Both ways is at least grammatically consistent, as ways is plural.
1.0 You dawg, I herd you like singing so I put some vocal cords inside your vocal cords, that way you can sing while you sing! EOS 1.0 I think you got downvoted because you said you dawg instead of yo dawg. EOS 1.0 awww... meme fail.	1.0 I still upmodded you cause I found it funny.

1.0 No. Every comment commentor stands or falls in the moment, in that thread. EOS 1.0 I agree, except that I will sometimes check a commentor's history to see if they're being sarcastic joking.	1.0 Or if more comments will give a better clue as to whether a poster is serious or an epic troll, in some cases.

1.0 Well, I guess I'm a demi god or something? Really, I just spend too much time on reddit. EOS 1.0 I was actually pretty proud of myself that i just recently passed 10,000 in comment karma. I really should spend my spare time doing something more constructive.	1.0 That may be difficult if you're the oddmanout. Or, as I first read it, the oddmonaut.
1.0 Yeah, you can get a lot of comment karma by just replying with memes. Bacon is good.	1.0 upmodded for mention of bacon. All your bacon are belong to us.

1.0 We are the cream of reddit discussion, to increase the number of subscribers means more dross. bigger numbers is not always better.	1.0 Reddit's design means bigger numbers are better, as long as we're mindful of our voting habits.

1.0 I'm also considering adding a feature where the oldest top level comment by the OP is floated to the top. Would this be of interest? EOS 1.0 I would personally like it...because if you are unable to find the OPs original comment, sometimes the AskReddit's just doesn't make sense EOS 1.0 Done.

1.0 Good trolling. High School freshmen don't know how to do physics. Nice try. EOS 1.0 Actually I think that is isolated to North American public schools.

1.0 Lucky you. I'm always talking up reddit to my friends, but I have yet to meet a single person who actually uses reddit.	1.0 I do that all the time. My friends are occasional readers at best.
1.0 What kind of teacher? EOS 1.0 Social studies history. EOS 1.0 Awesome. There is a serious lack of good history teachers, at least in our area. Good luck!	1.0 If there was a question that needed answering, I would have it answered by the next class.
1.0 You inspired me to actually buy a reddit shirt... but then I went to the store and it only had bobble heads and kids shirts.	1.0 Dammit you're right. Bollocks and whatnot.

1.0 He's not that funny but that old man that hangs out with him is hilarious.	1.0 Who is this Jeff guy?
1.0 His jokes appeal to middle America, they are not intellectually funny. It's the easiest kind of humor. Just like Carlos Mencia, or Larry the Cable Guy.	1.0 Agree on the humor, but I can still appreciate his skill. Mencia et al have lazy humor and no skill.
1.0 No. Because I do not make misteaks.	1.0 I thought I did once, but I was wrong.

A conversation between jailbait on reddit and CuntSmellersINC. I'm not sure what just happened but I think by reading those comments I managed to do something illegal.	1.0 Have a seat over there.
1.0 Thanks a lot I'll try that out. I guess what you're saying makes a lot more sense than I thought. Edit: I especially liked your calculus class analogy.	1.0 Yeah, we've got our youth, and that's all that matters. So, don't fret, just do, I'm gonna try.

1.0 Or we could create some kind of website where we could all express our feelings about various current events and funny stories. We could meet that way instead.	1.0 Something like a reddit group on Digg. That sort of thing?

1.0 Why do cops get to eat in restaurants in their uniforms?	1.0 The restaurant might actually like it. I would guess that having an officer in uniform would at least deter some one from robbing the place.
1.0 Cops hate the environment almost as much as they do homeless people in NYC.	1.0 Yeah because cops are the only ones who hate homeless people. Idiot, WE ALL hate homeless people!
1.0 Why do cops get to eat in restaurants in their uniforms? EOS 1.0 Because they don't get changed for lunch, so if something major happens they can respond.

1.0 And youd pay the same amount at the better uni too.	1.0 i know
1.0 Its always off. Enough dickheads refuse to use the subreddit for their political shit so you see plenty of it anyway.	1.0 That's why you turn off reddit.com, too.
1.0 When you buy a new vehicle, deluxe means the opposite. But when a vehicle reaches a certain age, deluxe again means deluxe, since there's less to go wrong.	1.0 Yeah, at least it can be worked on by a non scientist. I don't know if I can live without those little wipers for my headlights though?

1.0 I haven't seen it myself but I presume it's because it sucks and or represents less than admirable values.

Let's just stick with it sucks then.
1.0 So you never thought to... I don't know... go and see a bloody doctor about this mysterious fleshy tumour?! EOS 1.0 I'm more of a DIY kind of person, you see. I haven't died of cancer in the years since, so I'm satisfied with the results: would operate again A .	1.0 Kind of sounds like a giant wart.

1.0 Angelina Jolie is fuckin hot ! EOS 1.0 Angelina Jolie was fuckin hot ! Now, meh. EOS 1.0 Still hot. Just less hot than she was. I'd still bone her with a strap on, though. EOS 1.0 I'm gay.

1.0 get her to go see a Felleni flick. EOS 1.0 yeah, or maybe even one by fredrick fellini. EOS 1.0 or even better, one by Federico Fellini.	1.0 sure that isn't Fred Fellatio?

1.0 And I'm sure Reddit isn't going to be in a hurry to give us any details as to how exactly which pic is chosen, either. But, thank you anyway. EOS 1.0 Use the source.	1.0 Use the source, Luke?
1.0 Good King Wenceslas!	1.0 I always forget that one! Good choice!
1.0 Not a 'Christmas' song really, but in December I usually like to listen to My December by Linkin Park. It has a nostalgic feel to it for me.	1.0 I think that counts. I prefer to listen to music seasonally, so I know exactly what you mean.
1.0 And the vaguely german polish slavic singing. I just imagine a hungover Perry Como sipping on pepto bismol, smoking cigs, trying to bang it out before he heads to the titty bar.	1.0 Totally. I actually really like his vocal performance. He's almost reading it. In his sleep. The relaxed attitude is pretty awesome.

1.0 You miss winter? Funny. I'm thinking about moving to Texas to escape winter because I hate it so much.	1.0 Our winter is winter to us. We whine if it's 40 degrees or lower.
1.0 There's but one problem with that, I can't for the life of me, do a single push up. I tried, but I guess my arms must be too weak.	1.0 Start off doing the girly pushups where your knees are on the floor. When you can do a few of those, you can progress to the real ones.

1.0 You've essentially just described Google News with comments and vote up ifs	1.0 You've essentially just described reddit with later submissions merged onto the original thread.
1.0 Some submissions are better than others though. A self 'Some dude threw a shoe at Bush!' shouldn't prevent someone else from posting a link to the actual video.	1.0 Couldn't the video link be posted as a comment?
1.0 Or maybe just take down the weight of the lesser subreddits.	1.0 Yep I finally bit the bullet on that one.
1.0 What other examples do you have?	1.0 Mumbai bombings, F18 crash, Finnish High school shooting, Shoe throwing, Election night etc... Edit : Election night was the big one. That really sucked given how exciting the lead up was.

1.0 Who throws a shoe, honestly?	1.0 Isn't it a huge insult, culturally, to throw shoes? Like when they pulled down a statue of Saddam, they threw shoes at it.

1.0 Yes, I'm sure France would completely ignore all interests in Africa in the New World if Britain didn't have an empire. EOS 1.0 I am dead serious. France never needed an empire heck, it was just a whimsical folly. For example, it traded half of North Amrica for a few carribean islands!	1.0 I thought it was traded to Spain in order for them to join the war of Austrian succession against the British?

1.0 No, that would be inhumane. Humans are fine, but for the love of god not the cats. EOS 1.0 You seem to have said that sarcastically, but it is kind of inhumane. See, the cat has to go through that pain and it has no choice. EOS 1.0 Sedatives FTW EOS 1.0 That doesn't mean it doesn't hurt the next few days. Because, you know, IT DOES.	1.0 Really? Well, the more you know.
1.0 The creator of the poll is supposed to make the options and you vote up whatever option is true for you. Everybody else in this thread is a fucking reddidiot.	1.0 No, actually. It means they refuse to vote up or down and are voting sideways. Twice, to prove that despite the validity of the question, vote up ifs will not be tolerated.
1.0 I have a house in one city and an apartment in another. My car is parked in front of both. EOS 1.0 It's big cars like yours that are contributing so much to global warming.	1.0 Yeah, but nuthin' beats it for date nite!

1.0 I think most guys prefer the natural look because it looks better.	1.0 Yeah, but I'm saying that, on the subconscious level at least, it looks better because of the image of self confidence it gives off.
1.0 The less face paint the better... and while we are at it, get rid of those retarded high heel shoes...	1.0 Wearing makeup is exactly like having a sex change and then luring in an unsuspecting victim before breaking the news.

1.0 Why was Michael Jackson at K Mart? He heard boys' pants were half off.	1.0 That joke predates this millennium.
1.0 Aww, thanks mary, you're swell. EOS 1.0 why thank you. you are swell yourself EOS 1.0 Oh you two cleeeek	1.0 what's cleek?
1.0 Yes. Finals went better than expected, and I am forever done with Differential Equations. EOS 1.0 Until you actually need them... EOS 1.0 We both know that I will never need to use a Laplace Transform when I get a real job	1.0 Depends on what your job major is. If it involves electronic design or DSP, for example, you'll probably use them a lot.
1.0 i am sorry	1.0 Well, at least you can admit it was your fault.
1.0 Yup, I'm done with finals and off to Florida for 2 weeks on the beach, cya suckers!	1.0 Which beach? Maybe we'll run into each other. The water is cold as hell right now.
1.0 You want me to fail don't you. EOS 1.0 Here's a little orange envelope to waste 12 seconds of your time. Now get off reddit. EOS 1.0 You want me to fail don't you. EOS 1.0 Nah I want you to get off reddit and do your damn work. Unfortunately, the only way I can do that is in little orange envelope form. EOS 1.0 Godamnit man! EOS 1.0 Sorry, it's a vicious cycle. EOS 1.0 Well i do appreciate your dedication.	1.0 No problem, I've got work to be doing too.

1.0 Are you lolbacon? Cuz I don't like that guy.	1.0 Nope, this is my only active account. I deleted my old one. I'm not really a fan of multiple personality posting.
1.0 p3do is my favorite. I can't tell if he is a troll or actually a pedo. either way, his comments always are fun to read. EOS 1.0 Hasn't p3do been deleted? I haven't seen him in awhile.	1.0 The account has been deleted, but I'm sure the person behind the account is still around... somewhere.

1.0 looks around for name cries self to sleep EOS 1.0 I too was hoping to find my name. Also, I have never heard of you before this comment. EOS 1.0 I've seen you around a couple of times. All I really remember is that your wife is TheNonReligiousPopette.	1.0 She didn't want to start commenting on reddit at first for fear of upstaging me. Apparently she was right.
1.0 anyone in irc	1.0 Awww! hugs koryk
1.0 Out of all the redditors I can think of, he's the only one who I consistently laugh out loud from.	1.0 Thank ye mates, you've given me reason to shut the engine off and open the garage. Well, in a couple more minutes, the buzz is actually pretty sweet.
1.0 qghy2 He's had a lot of reddit love today, but he deserves a little more! EOS 1.0 I have such a redditcrush on him. oh no... he's going to read this and then he's going to know... and GAAH!	1.0 Well, you didn't even care enough to copypasta little hearts into your comment! Obviously I've moved past the redditcrush stage and am full blown in reddit love with the guy.
1.0 Well, boobs do help the hugging process.	1.0 Yeah, whenever I see two women hugging all I can think of is, Boobs touching.
1.0 Make a fort.	1.0 God damn beat me to it :P
1.0 Target practice. EOS 1.0 Wait a minute... didn't you used to spell your name differently????	1.0 No. If there is another HarryBalzanya on reddit I will be so pissed.

1.0 No, dumbass, you did not offend me. I was merely trying to impart to you the fact that people don't like people like you. EOS 1.0 People don't like Mark Cuban either, you think his Billionaire self gives a shit? Nope. EOS 1.0 Honestly, I bet he does. But whatever. Be a douche to your heart's content.	1.0 Thank you. We have now accomplished mutual destruction.

1.0 I just watched Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Not sure if it is indie but it was rather good.	1.0 Damn you, I came here to recommend that movie. I'd consider it Indy, and it is very good.
1.0 Get her on reddit. EOS 1.0 Your intentions are well friend, but I would discourage taking this advice. She might end up angry and bitter like some of us others who happened to get on reddit.	1.0 Who the fuck are you calling angry?!
1.0 Say exactly that to her. EOS 1.0 Agreed. If she still isn't interested, move on. You can keep torturing yourself forever, but you can't make her feel any differently than she does. EOS 1.0 What would be the fucking point? Maybe you guys missed the part where she already dumped him. EOS 1.0 Anything can change in time..even two people that may not have meshed the first go round. EOS 1.0 If she hasn't said anything since the breakup, she probably won't, and trying to convince her otherwise is just asking to be broken up with again.	1.0 He's clearly still pretty hung up on her. It probably won't change anything for her, but it might allow him to finally recognize it's over and walk away.
1.0 Live your life, be sad and die live your life, be happy and die. Choose. EOS 1.0 Choose life.	1.0 But don't choose heroin.
1.0 This is askreddit not tellreddit	1.0 I think Bob is wanting us to ask so therefore, it becomes ask, reddit .
1.0 I just don't think we should cultivate catering to stupidity around here. EOS 1.0 Yes, let's just do without, for spite's sake. That's so much better, in the long run. EOS 1.0 It isn't doing without anything there's a system. I don't subscribe to the idea that more options are always better. EOS 1.0 Why do I have the feeling you'd light candles with flint and tinder if you had your way?	1.0 Cuz the world is more beautiful when lit with candles!
1.0 Its rhyming slang for sweet .	1.0 Ok I had to double check your name, I thought it was bagsweat and your comment confused me.
1.0 The significance of my name is that it is the best username on reddit.	1.0 My vote would go to CuntSmellersINC, but crapfoodpants is pretty good too. Hey, are you familiar with any yellow, spongy, square sea creatures by any chance?
1.0 The original best thing! :D I doubt I would have picked the same thing if I wanted something specifically for Reddit, but I didn't feel like remembering another name. EOS 1.0 perhaps buttersideup ?	1.0 And then I'd just have to find a cat to harness the power of anti gravity!

1.0 why do we have to register? kind of eliminates the anonymity we would have from you. EOS 1.0 So that you can tag threads, look back at your own posts, and admins can ban spammers. Basically. EOS 1.0 I'd like to point out that 4chan has 2 out of 3 of those features though. EOS 1.0 I'd like to point out that 4chan is a shithole.	1.0 Oh I would not disagree. I'm just saying that it is technically feasible using only IP logs or cookies or whatever 4chan uses. I haven't been there in a year .

1.0 I thought Ayn Rand was right. EOS 1.0 How did someone manage to correct you? EOS 1.0 Well, to be honest, it wasn't someone, it was life. EOS 1.0 I thought so.

Aaron's, Ben's... the cat's... it's... why does it break this otherwise consistent way of declaring ownership??? EOS 1.0 Its is perfectly consistent with other words that are the same part of speech. His, hers, yours, ours, theirs... its. Do you write hi's and her's?	1.0 Using your logic he would probably write him's not hi's.

1.0 Yes! I had forgotten this one. Really, really awful. EOS 1.0 The second one's even worse than the first if that can be believed.	1.0 It can. Because it's a sequel. But that also means the first one made a substantial profit. Which is baffling.

1.0 your oily, contemptuous observations reek of jealousy and obsession . please write more.	1.0 I have never found the word oily to describe a piece of writing so accurately.
1.0 Youtube HD isn't HD. EOS 1.0 Technically, it is, the term HD is defined very loosely though.	1.0 What, as anything with a higher definition than what was previously offered?
1.0 Maybe it's because I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep? It's probably the other way around though...	1.0 If I didn't have trouble getting to sleep I wouldn't be here typing this comment right now...
1.0 You people need to stop thinking about my mom right before you fall asleep. Or send me pictures of your moms... .... and your friends' moms. EOS 1.0 I do not think about my friend's moms! That's sick. I adhere to a tight schedule.	1.0 And none of my friends moms are tight enough to be on that schedule!
1.0 I've contemplated leaving a voice recorder near my bed, so if anything pops in there that is gold I capture it.	1.0 Probably a good idea... I hate the sound of my own voice, so for vanity's sake I would never do this. XD
1.0 I like to imagine things I would change if I had omnipotent power, and count up from 1. I usually fall asleep before I get to 20.	1.0 Whenever I try to count myself to sleep, I always end up thinking the thought: Oh, hey. I stopped counting.
1.0 I'd fill the bathtub with litter, then take baths in the litter box. Bonus being that you'd only have to scoop the poop every month or so EOS 1.0 I think I will go with your suggestion. Thanks. Now Buffy will no longer be the Bath Tub Pooper and can return to her duties as the Slayer.	1.0 You can also get another cat, preferably one from the street that is not friends with your cat. Then keep the new cat in the bathtub.
1.0 Shut the door.	1.0 that is too simple!
1.0 On a related note, how do I get my cat to stop pissing in the dog's water dish?	1.0 Why would you want to stop that?
1.0 Rub its face in the turd.	1.0 surprised this wasn't said first. If you are too kind to rub the face in then rub the paws in same effect. It will stop after that.
1.0 Rub its face in the turd.	1.0 This is how I house trained my dog. Stuck her nose right up to her business, then put her outside. It sure worked, and she's the happiest, smartest dog I know.
1.0 Ah! Another thought. Leave an inch of water in the bath all the time. EOS 1.0 ...but don't be surprised when you get a ring of mildew around the inside of the tub either. EOS 1.0 Have you thought about leaving about an inch of water in the tub?	1.0 Or perhaps.... Leaving around 1 inch of water in the bath tub?
1.0 Cash, beef jerky and beer. Exactly what I asked for.	1.0 I like your style.
1.0 Good Omens is great. I really need to get Anathem but it looks to be the size of a small child.	1.0 Yeah, but I can't wait to tackle it. I've read a lot of good reviews about it and I really enjoyed Snow Crash, so hopefully it will meet expectations.
1.0 Acknowledged, but I wanted to show where the recursion finally breaks down, and saying Machine language works by magic doesn't really cut it.	1.0 Ah, that is true.
1.0 Acknowledged, but I wanted to show where the recursion finally breaks down, and saying Machine language works by magic doesn't really cut it.	1.0 Well then you need to go down lower than gates into relays transistors, electricity magnetics, etc.
1.0 Magic. Got it. EOS 1.0 They're not magic tricks, they're illusions. Tricks are for whores. EOS 1.0 Yeah but, where did the assembler come from?	1.0 God created it on the seventh day.
1.0 Magic. Got it. EOS 1.0 They're not magic tricks, they're illusions. Tricks are for whores. EOS 1.0 Great opportunity for an Arrested quote. Downvoted for not taking it.	1.0 Yeah I paraphrased it. Sorry if it offended anyone, I do love the show if that's any compensation.
1.0 Don't shave.	1.0 i agree. only girls cut their hair
1.0 Keep growing. Once you get a nice unibrow going, you can start waxing them out the sides. That will be kick ass.	1.0 Interesting idea, but I think I'll pass.
1.0 Do you want to look like a terrorist? Don't shave. Do you want to possibly get in a girl's panties? Shave. EOS 1.0 What's this with having to shave to get into panties? I would think that a rugged look would be more down with the ladies. EOS 1.0 The only thing I can think of why rockymicky would say that: chafe? EOS 1.0 I don't really want to get into a girl's panties anyway... EOS 1.0 But...but...the panties! First you get the beard, then you get the razor, then you get the woman...according to rockymicky. EOS 1.0 I'd like to get into a guy's panties. Is the process still the same?	1.0 Well I'd imagine chafing isn't such an issue any more. Go nuts!
1.0 I'm a fan of Namecheap.com	1.0 me too
1.0 because they used jets. if you use an automobile or just a lone person, to bomb the hell out of something, that's what makes you the terrorist.	1.0 soo.. 4 terr'ists 1 plane. what do you make of that?
1.0 yes. but i'm no more repulsed when i see two men making out, than i am if i were to see two elderly making out.	1.0 What about 2 elderly men?
1.0 what about two gay lesbians? would you feel nothing?	1.0 If they're hot, I definitely feel something.
1.0 what about two gay lesbians? would you feel nothing?	1.0 A gay lesbian? Wait, you know that's redundant, right? Well, depending on various factors, it may still be a turn on.
1.0 I own elfbang.com and cripples.org, what should I do with my sites?	1.0 Combine them into one mega site with elves banging cripples.
1.0 I own elfbang.com and cripples.org, what should I do with my sites?	1.0 sell them?
1.0 An epic battle of animated gifs. Preferably humans versus unicorns. Thank you. EOS 1.0 Zombies versus unicorns.	1.0 I....I don't know who to root for more!
1.0 Is there a dental college nearby ? The rates are lower for them to practice on you.	1.0 This is probably your best option.
1.0 Is there a dental college nearby ? The rates are lower for them to practice on you.	1.0 Why doesn't everyone do this?
1.0 That's not going to fix it.	1.0 Well, it might make the tooth fall out. Problem solved!
1.0 Not everyone qualifies for medicaid EOS 1.0 I realize it's not the universal health care that many folks want, but it does cover the poor and the indigent.	1.0 Not everyone qualifies for medicaid
1.0 Oil of clove works like a miracle on dental pain, rub some on the spot and ahh. It won't cure the ill, just dulls the hurt.	1.0 Yeah, but tastes like shit.
1.0 yeah I know. Not statistically significant. Don't you just wish you could set up a study for every interesting thought intuition deduction you have.	1.0 afaik there already have been studies done, hence me knowing about that. I have pretty fucked teeth, so I did a lot of research into dental stuff.
1.0 No, I'm in Amsterdam, and that isn't boring at all.	1.0 Fuck you.

1.0 Yes. I recently picked up this thing someone told me was called book . EOS 1.0 I here those things are pretty good,plus one your done it doubles as paper fro your pets kennel.	1.0 Dad you're drunk, log off and call mom, she's worried.

1.0 Your life sucks.	1.0 Narrator rocks.
1.0 No, I'm in Amsterdam, and that isn't boring at all. EOS 1.0 I'm in Amsterdam too but I am bored stiff waiting for the torrent to finish so I can watch a movie EOS 1.0 Do some drugs to pass the time. EOS 1.0 Done the drugs. Watched the movie. Damn, time to be bored again.	1.0 Do more drugs. Then watch the same movie. One time I ate mushrooms and watched Super Troopers three times in a row. It's a very colorful movie.
1.0 For all of those who are bored: Learn to program! You will never be bored again. And it is actually productive, unlike the reddit rat maze crack button.	1.0 I've found that trying to learn to program works for me. Everytime I try I always find something more interesting to do, and the boredom disappears.
1.0 I really don't find a whole lot of difference between you and some white trash who's life consists of soap operas and qvc.	1.0 Vacation not life.
1.0 go outside, you pale fuck! EOS 1.0 I'm in jeans, a T shirt, and no shoes. There's snow on the ground. Are you trying to kill me? EOS 1.0 ever roll around in snow for 10 seconds in your underwear? Shiiiiit...I did it when I was 10...pusseh!!	1.0 You're supposed to have a sauna first!
1.0 what's a forum? EOS 1.0 like Reddit, but without the links Never understood the point myself.	1.0 maybe OP means 12chan?
1.0 Narrator joke. From Family Guy. EOS 1.0 Odd, I was thinking it was some sort of depressing Superman monologue.	1.0 ...that's an intriguing thought, actually. grabs notepad
1.0 I was just thinking to myself: Gosh, Nethack is not nearly complicated enough. And it's too goddamned pretty! EOS 1.0 The complication that makes it hard to learn initially is also part of what makes it so much fun when you've finished learning.	1.0 You mean the novel interface design for absolutely everything? As far as I can tell, you're supposed to navigate the help system with a number pad. I'll pass.
1.0 I've made it a challenge to give up one website a day. Today was Facebook, and hopefully tomorrow'll be Reddit.	1.0 You should do it consecutively, so at the end you'll be freed from the internet.
1.0 This was the best moment in Family Guy history.	1.0 love it so much. Love noir cinema.
1.0 Try a Daffy Duck cartoon!	1.0 Darkwing Duck if you want to go all out.
1.0 Nope, I got a request from someone to append that to my comment, and I was happy to blindly oblidge, assuming it was a Firefly reference.	1.0 You had better come back and reply to my comment once you've seen the episode it's referring to! o Edit: Or just PM me p
1.0 Not really. Buying DVDs is what brought us Serenity.	1.0 Wish I could upmod you more. Please folks, vote for good series with your dollars.
1.0 im not a fan of television series. matter of fact I don't ever watch anything on TV other than educational or news related programming.	1.0 your distinction between the two media is... problematic.
1.0 Asteroids. They're up there, waiting to strike me down.... I can feel it.	1.0 You mean gravity?
1.0 Asteroids. They're up there, waiting to strike me down.... I can feel it.	1.0 I am watching for the inevitable gamma ray burst.
1.0 His New Year's resolution was to come out to reddit. New username: JunkSmellersInc EOS 1.0 I believe its CockSmellersINC	1.0 I like the rhyme it makes it less likely to mistake him for someone else.
1.0 In a few weeks it'll be obvious what his new handle is.	1.0 We should have a contest to pick one for him. Like, how about TwatSniffersCORP
1.0 I should change mine. I think some of my family members read my posts.	1.0 I'm sorry, Dave. I can't let you do that.
1.0 off topic, what is the name of the symbol at the end of the title?	1.0 it's an interrobang. reddit's latest fad, but still sadly underused in the real world.
1.0 The picture he posted in the thread we all know was certainly of a strapping young lad... EOS 1.0 What a waste of 20,000 comment karma though. He didn't even redeem them for prizes before deleting...	1.0 That we know of...
1.0 I'm sure he'll turn up sooner or later....perhaps we should start a pool on who it is? EOS 1.0 I'm the Iron Man. I'm the Batman. I'm CuntSmellersINC.	1.0 It's a bird! It's a plan! It's a business for the promotion of smelling female genitals!
1.0 Same thing as reqqit? EOS 1.0 I can honestly say I miss reqqit's posts.	1.0 Maybe CuntSmellersINC was also reqqit?

1.0 I believe he likes to change names once in awhile... EOS 1.0 AH! so he was reqqit! it all makes sense.	1.0 I asked him once, but he denied it. He said he blogged with reqqit, but he's always said he was not reqqit.
1.0 I believe he likes to change names once in awhile... EOS 1.0 AH! so he was reqqit! it all makes sense.	1.0 I lol'd your username.

1.0 Small Wonder?	1.0 What the hell are you talkin' about?
1.0 The subreddit would have some sort of system for keeping track of favors... people could then use their good deeds as a sort of currency when they wanted a favor.	1.0 Am I missing something? What favors good deeds?
1.0 I just want a foot rub subreddit.	1.0 We've discussed this. It isn't going to happen until you begin to wash. Understand? With soap.
1.0 I see no problem with it, are you upset because its not real child porn? We aren't down with that EOS 1.0 speak for yourself EOS 1.0 This. How is it that downloading music for free hurts the music industry and downloading child porn for free helps the child porn industry?	1.0 Well I don't see many people selling child porn.
1.0 I should have kissed her.	1.0 If it makes you feel any better things were going swimmingly for me until I kissed her. After that she wanted nothing to do with me.

1.0 The godfather EOS 1.0 That is probably the most perfectly constructed novel I've ever read. Puzo was a master craftsman.	1.0 Yeah, after reading it, i just feel like nothing can top it. I wish it could have gone on forever...
1.0 G del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid	1.0 That's the best book I've never quite finished reading.
1.0 G del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid	1.0 getting it for my birthday on tuesday, so excited

1.0 Still Life with Woodpecker Tom Robbins EOS 1.0 I loved Jitterbug Perfume .	1.0 Another fav, especially Robbins' description of Kudra's dematerialization in the wharf, and Robbins' descriptions of Heaven and Hell.
1.0 Possibly the one I just finished: Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff Definitely one of the funniest I've read.	1.0 Haha, absolutely. I loved it. He wrote another about whale watching which was fantastic also. Not quite as good as Biff, but it has the same style of comedy.
1.0 The Old Man and The Sea. I was forced to read it at age six. I like Sometimes A Great Notion.... Lately anything by Michael Pollan. EOS 1.0 Least you didn't have to act it out....	1.0 uh... actually I did.
1.0 I liked that one about the goat! EDIT Heh heh heh! Goat. EOS 1.0 We all know that George reads books about homosexers. EOS 1.0 That don't even make no sense . That goat wasn't no homosexer .

1.0 The Old Man and The Sea. I was forced to read it at age six. I like Sometimes A Great Notion.... Lately anything by Michael Pollan. EOS 1.0 I despise the writing style of Mr. Hemingway. It is far too simplistic and he maddens me with short sentences. EOS 1.0 Well go get some James Joyce. EOS 1.0 Oh gawd. Joyce is the other extreme. Him and Joseph Conrad are the only authors I've been unable to understand so far.	1.0 My hero is E.B white
1.0 My thought would be that our life is out of balance.	1.0 And that was 25 years ago.
1.0 My thoughts: Whatever you do... Do not watch the sequels, Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi. Nothing but suckage compared to the first one, I couldn't even make it 15min into either. EOS 1.0 I thought Powaqqatsi was as good as Koyaanisqatsi. Naqoyqatsi not great.	1.0 To each his her own, I guess. Maybe I wasn't stoned enough when I tried watching the second two.
1.0 tone deaf much? EOS 1.0 glass as a whole, not specifically koyaanisquatsi EOS 1.0 nice one, missed your original point	1.0 lol, i could probably use to provide context for my random 4am posts. Seemed to make perfect sense at the time D

1.0 I learned that, soon, I'll be busting out of this uterus.	1.0 Lies! There is no out of this uterus, sorry pal.
1.0 I learned that starbuck is a cylon from a google image search gone wrong, I am only half way through season 2. This sucks.	1.0 Don't worry, there's a lot more to that plotline than just that maybe true statement. You definitely haven't wrecked it for yourself yet.
1.0 I learned that starbuck is a cylon from a google image search gone wrong, I am only half way through season 2. This sucks. EOS 1.0 I gave up on that a few seasons back, but I'm still a little upset to know that.	1.0 The first season was too good to be true, the sci fi channel will not match top that for a long time.
1.0 The difference between a Dana 35 and a Dana 44. EOS 1.0 Well, what is it?	1.0 Dana 9.
1.0 Where can I download it?	1.0 ftp: ftp.ncbi.nih.gov genbank genomes It's really not that exciting or useful unless you plan on investing a serious amount of time learning biology and bioinformatics.
1.0 At 10 weeks our baby is roughly the size of a kumquat, and has hair and fingernails already! EOS 1.0 Woah, they grow hair and fingernails before, like, brains and stuff? Biology is weird. Congrats on the baby though! EOS 1.0 I'm pretty sure the baby already has a brain.	1.0 Oh fair enough, but it is tiny. I just think it's funny it's already human y and fingernailed when it's the size of a kumquat
1.0 I learned that, soon, I'll be busting out of this uterus. EOS 1.0 You know what, you should have made a new account once your 'user for' thing reached 9 months. That would have been epic.	1.0 You're assuming that it is a human fetus.

1.0 I learned that tolls on the Garden State Parkway have gone up to 1.00 each, and on the Tappan Zee Bridge to 4.50.	1.0 6 on the Bridge and Tunnel crossings from Jersey into Manhattan if I remember correctly. Maybe more. I remember when they were 4, and I thought that was expensive.
1.0 That Doubt is an incredibly boring movie.	1.0 Thanks for the advance notice. Saved me good money. Go see The Wrestler, or Cadillac Records instead.
1.0 Isn't there a subreddit that is specifically meant for the announcements of new subreddits? This isn't exactly a question so askreddit is also off... EOS 1.0 I sense that AskReddit is mutating into a general purpose social forum.	1.0 Too bad Plorf deleted his account. AskReddit could have mutated into a social networking site with his skills.
1.0 I love playing my cello. Upmod, though I wouldn't recommend it for the OP as his first instrument. Remember ELO? They made cello cool.	1.0 ELO is awesome!
1.0 That was pretty stupid. Even for copypasta.	1.0 Most thoughts are, but since I happened to have some, I supposed I should answer dirkachbar's question honestly.
1.0 i hope this isn't an essay for something. there isn't nearly enough details for each individual point for me to find this anything more than a false comparison.
